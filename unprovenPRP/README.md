Primality of these probable primes (in the minimal sets for bases 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 28, 30) are not certificated yet (technically, probable primality tests (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_algorithm) such as Miller–Rabin primality test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/MillersTest.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Miller-Rabin_pseudoprimality_test, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rabin-MillerStrongPseudoprimeTest.html) and Baillie–PSW primality test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baillie%E2%80%93PSW_primality_test, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Baillie-PSWPrimalityTest.html) are used for these numbers, because of their sizes and neither N−1 nor N+1 can be >= 25% factored (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Factorization, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeFactorization.html), all known primality tests (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Primality_test, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimalityTest.html) run far too slowly (the CPU time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_time) is longer than the age of the universe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe)) to run on these numbers, the only known primality test with logarithmic time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Logarithmic_time) is AKS primality test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test), but it has time complexity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) O(log(n)^12) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) and too large), if they are in fact primes, then they are minimal primes to the corresponding bases.

All these numbers are strong probable primes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_pseudoprime, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/StrongPRP.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/StrongPseudoprime.html) to bases 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61 (see https://oeis.org/A014233), and strong Lucas probable primes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_pseudoprime#Strong_Lucas_pseudoprimes, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/StrongLucasPseudoprime.html) with parameters (P, Q) defined by Selfridge's Method A (see https://oeis.org/A217255), and trial factored (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/TrialDivision.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Trial_factoring, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TrialDivision.html) to 10^16 (thus, all these numbers are Baillie–PSW probable primes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baillie%E2%80%93PSW_primality_test, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Baillie-PSWPrimalityTest.html)), and since all of them are > 10^25000, thus the property that they are in fact composite is less than 10^(−2000) (but still not zero!), see https://primes.utm.edu/notes/prp_prob.html and https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1989-53-188/S0025-5718-1989-0982368-4/S0025-5718-1989-0982368-4.pdf (thus, we can 99.999999...999999% (with 2000 9's) say that the minimal sets for bases 11, 16, 22, 30 are these four sets, but we still can not 100% say this)
