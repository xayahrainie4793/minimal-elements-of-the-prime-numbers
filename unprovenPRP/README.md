Primality of these probable primes (in the minimal sets for bases 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 30) are not certificated yet, if they are in fact primes, then they are minimal primes to the corresponding bases.

All these numbers are strong probable primes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_pseudoprime, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/StrongPRP.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/StrongPseudoprime.html) to bases 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61 (see https://oeis.org/A014233), and strong Lucas probable primes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_pseudoprime#Strong_Lucas_pseudoprimes, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/StrongLucasPseudoprime.html) with parameters (P, Q) defined by Selfridge's Method A (see https://oeis.org/A217255), and trial factored to 10^16 (thus, all these numbers are Baillie–PSW probable primes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baillie%E2%80%93PSW_primality_test, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Baillie-PSWPrimalityTest.html)), and since all of them are > 10^25000, thus the property that they are in fact composite is less than 10^(−2000) (but still not zero!), see https://primes.utm.edu/notes/prp_prob.html and https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1989-53-188/S0025-5718-1989-0982368-4/S0025-5718-1989-0982368-4.pdf (thus, we can 99.999999...% (with 2000 9's) say that the minimal sets for bases 11, 22, 30 are these three sets, but we still can not 100% say this)

If 5(7^62668) (base 11) is in fact composite, then 5{7} will be an additional unsolved family for base 11.

If C(5^23755)C (base 13) is in fact composite, then C{5}C will be an additional unsolved family for base 13.

If 8(0^32017)111 (base 13) is in fact composite, then 8{0}111 will be an additional unsolved family for base 13.

If D(B^32234) (base 16) is in fact composite, then D{B} will be an additional unsolved family for base 16.

If (4^72785)DD (base 16) is in fact composite, then {4}DD will be an additional unsolved family for base 16.

If B(K^22001)5 (base 22) is in fact composite, then B{K}5 will be an additional unsolved family for base 22.

If I(0^24608)D (base 30) is in fact composite, then I{0}D will be an additional unsolved family for base 30.
