These are the Primo (https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Primo) primality certificates (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_certificate, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/Certificate.html) for the minimal primes > 10^299 (local copy from factordb (http://factordb.com/))

e.g. "certificate11_1065" means the primality certificate for the 1065th minimal prime in base 11, i.e. the primality certificate for the prime (A^713)58 in base 11

Primes which either N−1 or N+1 is trivially 100% factored need not primality certificates, since they can be easily proven primes using N−1 test (https://primes.utm.edu/prove/prove3_1.html) or N+1 test (https://primes.utm.edu/prove/prove3_2.html)
