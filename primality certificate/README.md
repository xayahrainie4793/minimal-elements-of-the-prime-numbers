These are the Primo primality certificates for the minimal primes > 10^299 (local copy from factordb)

e.g. "certificate11_1065" means the primality certificate for the 1065th minimal prime in base 11, i.e. the primality certificate for the prime (A^713)58 in base 11

Primes which either N−1 or N+1 is trivially 100% factored need not primality certificates, since they can be easily proven primes using N−1 test or N+1 test
