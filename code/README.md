This set of C++ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) programs must be run with *GMP* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library, https://gmplib.org/)

This set of programs uses many number theoretic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Number_theory, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NumberTheory.html) functions in *GMP* library (see https://gmplib.org/manual/Number-Theoretic-Functions.html), and we use the *GMP* function *mpz_probab_prime_p* (see https://faculty.lynchburg.edu/~nicely/misc/mpzspsp.html) to test the probable primality of the numbers, this function is combination of the Baillie–PSW probable primality test (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baillie%E2%80%93PSW_primality_test, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Baillie-PSWPrimalityTest.html), the Miller–Rabin probable primality test (https://t5k.org/prove/prove2_3.html, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_pseudoprime, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/MillersTest.html, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/StrongPRP.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Miller-Rabin_pseudoprimality_test, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Rabin-MillerStrongPseudoprimeTest.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/StrongPseudoprime.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/pseudo.htm#rabin, http://www.numericana.com/answer/pseudo.htm#strong, http://www.javascripter.net/math/primes/millerrabinprimalitytest.htm, http://ntheory.org/data/spsps.txt, https://faculty.lynchburg.edu/~nicely/misc/mpzspsp.html, http://factordb.com/prooffailed.php, https://sites.google.com/view/strong-pseudoprime, https://sites.google.com/view/bases-strong-pseudoprime, https://oeis.org/A001262, https://oeis.org/A020229, https://oeis.org/A020231, https://oeis.org/A020233, https://oeis.org/A072276, https://oeis.org/A056915, https://oeis.org/A074773, https://oeis.org/A014233, https://oeis.org/A006945, https://oeis.org/A181782, https://oeis.org/A071294, https://oeis.org/A141768, https://oeis.org/A195328, https://oeis.org/A329759, https://oeis.org/A298756) of first 50 prime bases (see https://oeis.org/A014233 and https://oeis.org/A141768 and https://oeis.org/A001262 and https://oeis.org/A074773) (we use reps = 50, thus the first 50 prime bases), and trial division (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/TrialDivision.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Trial_factoring, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TrialDivision.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/factoring.htm#trial, https://oeis.org/A189172) to about 10<sup>9</sup>, thus all numbers in the data are Baillie–PSW probable primes (i.e. both strong probable primes to base 2 (see https://oeis.org/A001262) and strong Lucas pseudoprimes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_pseudoprime#Strong_Lucas_pseudoprimes, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/StrongLucasPseudoprime.html, http://ntheory.org/data/slpsps-baillie.txt) with parameters (*P*, *Q*) defined by Selfridge's Method *A* (see https://oeis.org/A217255)), i.e. either primes or Baillie–PSW pseudoprimes, and no known composites which pass the Baillie–PSW probable prime test, and no composites < 2<sup>64</sup> pass the Baillie–PSW probable prime test (see http://ntheory.org/pseudoprimes.html and https://faculty.lynchburg.edu/~nicely/misc/bpsw.html), thus if a number in the data is in fact composite, it will be a pseudoprime to the Baillie–PSW probable prime test, which currently no single example is known!

The program "searchpp.cc" is searching the smallest (probable) prime in non-simple families (for the examples of non-simple families, see https://stdkmd.net/nrr/prime/primecount3.htm and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/prime/primecount3.txt (only base 10 families)), non-simple families usually have small primes if they cannot be ruled out as only containing composites by covering congruence, see the *README* file in the main page.

(the section below uses the notation in http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Papers/minimal5.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_11.pdf), i.e. "*X* ◁ *Y*" means "*X* is a subsequence of *Y*")

e.g. for the non-simple family {7}{4}1 in base *b* = 8, we can separate it to these families:

* Family {7}1, its smallest prime is 7<sub>12</sub>1 (see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=8%5E%28n%2B1%29-7&use=n&n=1&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)

* Family {7}441, its smallest prime is 7<sub>84</sub>441 (not minimal prime, since 7<sub>12</sub>1 ◁ 7<sub>84</sub>441) (see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=8%5E%28n%2B3%29-223&use=n&n=0&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)
* Family {7}4441, its smallest prime is 7<sub>233</sub>4441 (not minimal prime, since 7<sub>12</sub>1 ◁ 7<sub>233</sub>4441) (see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=8%5E%28n%2B4%29-1759&use=n&n=0&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)
* Family {7}44441, its smallest prime is 7<sub>56</sub>44441 (not minimal prime, since 7<sub>12</sub>1 ◁ 7<sub>56</sub>44441) (see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=8%5E%28n%2B5%29-14047&use=n&n=0&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)
* Family {7}444441, it has no primes since all numbers in this family are divisible by 7 (see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=8%5E%28n%2B6%29-112351&use=n&n=0&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)
* Family {7}4444441, its smallest prime is 77774444441 (see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=8%5E%28n%2B7%29-898783&use=n&n=0&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)

* Family 7{4}1, its smallest prime is 74<sub>7</sub>1 (see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=%2853*8%5E%28n%2B1%29-25%29%2F7&use=n&n=0&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)
* Family 77{4}1, it has no primes since all numbers in this family are divisible by 5 (see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=%28445*8%5E%28n%2B1%29-25%29%2F7&use=n&n=0&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)
* Family 777{4}1, its smallest prime is 7774<sub>11</sub>1 (not minimal prime, since 4<sub>8</sub>1 ◁ 7774<sub>11</sub>1) (see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=%283581*8%5E%28n%2B1%29-25%29%2F7&use=n&n=0&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)
* Family 7777{4}1, its smallest prime is 77774444441 (see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=%2828669*8%5E%28n%2B1%29-25%29%2F7&use=n&n=0&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)

and thus we found that the smallest prime in the non-simple family {7}{4}1 in base 8 is 77774444441

For another example, for the non-simple family {8}{3}5 in base *b* = 9, we can separate it to these families:

* Family {8}5, it has no primes since all numbers in this family can be factored as difference of two squares (note: since we only count the primes > *b*, thus the prime 5 is not counted) (see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=9%5E%28n%2B1%29-4&use=n&n=1&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)
* Family {8}35, it has no primes since all numbers in this family are divisible by 2 (in fact, always divisible by 8) (in fact, also all numbers in this family can be factored as difference of two squares) (see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=9%5E%28n%2B2%29-49&use=n&n=0&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)

* Family {3}5, it has no primes since all numbers in this family are divisible by either 2 or 5 (note: since we only count the primes > *b*, thus the prime 5 is not counted) (see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=%283*9%5E%28n%2B1%29%2B13%29%2F8&use=n&n=1&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)

and thus we found that the smallest prime in the non-simple family {8}{3}5 in base 9 is 8333333335

The program "searchpm.cc" is searching the smallest (probable) prime in simple families up to length 1000.

There is also a *Pari*/*GP* (https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/) program code to compute the first few minimal primes (say < 2<sup>32</sup>) in base *b* (this program looks at all primes one by one, to test whether a prime is a minimal prime or not, and has time complexity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) *O*(*n*) when compute the minimal primes ≤ *n* (where *O* is the big *O* notation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/BigOh.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Big-ONotation.html)), thus this program would need a time longer than the age of the universe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe) to test to the largest minimal prime for base *b* = 10 (i.e. 5000000000000000000000000000027), even if we can test 10<sup>6</sup> primes per second (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second)), hence to do this is impractically, not to mention base *b* = 24, whether the set of the C++ programs in this page has time complexity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) *O*(*log*(*n*)<sup>3</sup>) (where *log* is the natural logarithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Log.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NaturalLogarithm.html)) when compute the minimal primes ≤ *n*, thus it has a polynomial time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity#Polynomial_time, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PolynomialTime.html)):

a(n,k,b)=v=[];for(r=1,length(digits(n,b)),if(r+length(digits(k,2))-length(digits(n,b))>0 && digits(k,2)[r+length(digits(k,2))-length(digits(n,b))]==1,v=concat(v,digits(n,b)[r])));fromdigits(v,b)
