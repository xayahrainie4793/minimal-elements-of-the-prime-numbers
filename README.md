A Prime Game:

Write down a multidigit prime number (i.e. a prime number > 10), and I can always strike out 0 or more digits to get a prime in this list:

{11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 227, 251, 257, 277, 281, 349, 409, 449, 499, 521, 557, 577, 587, 727, 757, 787, 821, 827, 857, 877, 881, 887, 991, 2087, 2221, 5051, 5081, 5501, 5581, 5801, 5851, 6469, 6949, 8501, 9001, 9049, 9221, 9551, 9649, 9851, 9949, 20021, 20201, 50207, 60649, 80051, 666649, 946669, 5200007, 22000001, 60000049, 66000049, 66600049, 80555551, 555555555551, 5000000000000000000000000000027}

e.g.

* Write down the prime 149 → I can strike out the digit 4, to get the prime 19

* Write down the largest known Fermat prime 65537 → I can strike out the 6 and the 3, to get the prime 557 (also I can choose to strike out the 6 and two 5's, to get the prime 37) (also I can choose to strike out two 5's and the 3, to get the prime 67) (also I can choose to strike out the 6, one 5, and the 7, to get the prime 53)
* Write down the famous repunit prime 1111111111111111111 (with 19 1's) → I can strike out 17 1's, to get the prime 11
* Write down the prime 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007 (which is the next prime after 10<sup>60</sup>) → I can strike out all 0's, to get the prime 17
* Write down the prime 95801 → I can strike out the 9, to get the prime 5801
* Write down the prime 946969 → I can strike out the first 9 and two 6's, to get the prime 499

These primes are called **minimal primes**.

Let *b* > 1 be a natural number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Natural_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NaturalNumber.html). A minimal prime base *b* is a prime number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Prime.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Prime, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumber.html, https://www.numbersaplenty.com/set/prime_number/, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#definition, http://irvinemclean.com/maths/pfaq2.htm, https://oeis.org/A000040, https://t5k.org/lists/small/1000.txt, https://t5k.org/lists/small/10000.txt, https://t5k.org/lists/small/100000.txt, https://t5k.org/lists/small/millions/) greater than (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_than, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Greater.html) *b* whose base-*b* (i.e. the positional numeral system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_numeral_system) with radix (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Radix.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Base, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Radix.html) *b*) representation has no proper subsequence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Subsequence.html) which is also a prime number greater than *b*.

For example, 857 is a minimal prime in decimal (base *b* = 10) because there is no prime > 10 among the shorter subsequences of the digits: 8, 5, 7, 85, 87, 57. The subsequence does not have to consist of consecutive digits, so 149 is not a minimal prime in decimal (base *b* = 10) (because 19 is prime and 19 > 10). But it does have to be in the same order; so, for example, 991 is still a minimal prime in decimal (base *b* = 10) even though a subset of the digits can form the shorter prime 19 > 10 by changing the order.

Now we extend minimal primes to bases *b* other than 10.

The minimal elements (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_element) (https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MaximalElement.html for maximal element, the dual of minimal element, unfortunately there is no article "minimal element" in mathworld, a minimal element of a set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Set.html) under a partial ordering binary relation

36 also has number theory significances, although 24 is the most important number in number theory (see https://sites.google.com/view/24-important-number-theory), but the next half of 24 (i.e. 12) numbers after 24 immediately have four perfect powers (https://oeis.org/A001597, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_power, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PerfectPower.html,

are more interesting since a large minimal prime in base *b* = *m*<sup>*r*</sup> can be written as a base *m* form, and both the top definitely primes page (https://t5k.org/primes/lists/all.txt) and the generalized Proth/Riesel primes page (https://pzktupel.de/Primetables/TableProthGen.php, https://pzktupel.de/Primetables/TableRieselGen.php) convert the perfect power bases (i.e. *b* = *m*<sup>*r*</sup> with *r* > 1) to their "ground bases" (https://oeis.org/A052410) (i.e. *b* = *m*), i.e. the bases are normalized, e.g. it converts the prime 2805222×25<sup>2805222</sup>+1 to

converts the prime 2622×121<sup>810960</sup>−1 to 2622×11<sup>1621920</sup>−1 (i.e. converts base 121 = 11<sup>2</sup> to base 11) (see https://t5k.org/primes/page.php?id=119929 for the entry of this

such base *b* is better), and for the case for base *b* = 36, it is divisible by 2 and 3, and the number one less than 36 is the product of the next two primes (5 and 7), it can approximate many

mean that the number 35+1 = 36 has many divisors), but these are not the main reason, the main reason is base *b* = 36 is the maximum base for which it is possible to write the numbers with the symbols 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 and A, B, C, ..., Z (i.e. the 10 Arabic numerals (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArabicNumeral.html) and the 26 Latin letters (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet)), i.e. bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36 are case-insensitive (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case-insensitive) alphanumeric (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphanumericals) numeral system using ASCII (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) characters (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)), while bases *b* > 36 are not)**

A string (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/String.html) *x* is a subsequence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Subsequence.html) of another string *y*, if *x* can be obtained from *y* by deleting zero or more of the characters (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)) (in this project, digits (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_digit, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Digit, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Digit.html)) in *y*. For example, 514 is a subsequence of 352148, "STRING" is a subsequence of "MEISTERSINGER". In contrast, 758 is not a subsequence of 378259, "ABC" is not a subsequence of "CBACACBA", since the characters (in this project, digits) must be in the same order. The empty string (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_string) *𝜆* is a subsequence of every string. There are 2<sup>*n*</sup> subsequences of a string with length *n*, e.g. the subsequences of 123456 are (totally 2<sup>6</sup> = 64 subsequences):

*𝜆*, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 23, 24, 25, 26, 34, 35, 36, 45, 46, 56, 123, 124, 125, 126, 134, 135, 136, 145, 146, 156, 234, 235, 236, 245, 246, 256, 345, 346, 356, 456, 1234, 1235, 1236, 1245, 1246, 1256, 1345, 1346, 1356, 1456, 2345, 2346, 2356, 2456, 3456, 12345, 12346, 12356, 12456, 13456, 23456, 123456

"The set of strings ordered by subsequence" is a partially ordered set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartialOrder.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartiallyOrderedSet.html), since this binary relation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinaryRelation.html) is reflexive (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Reflexive.html), antisymmetric (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisymmetric_relation), and transitive (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation), and thus we can draw its Hasse diagram (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagram, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HasseDiagram.html) and find its greatest element (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_element), least element (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_element), maximal elements (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_element, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MaximalElement.html), and minimal elements (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_element), however, the greatest element and least element may not exist, and for an infinite set (such as the set of the "prime numbers > *b*" strings in base *b* (for a given base *b* ≥ 2), for the proofs for that there are infinitely many primes, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_theorem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclidsTheorems.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#euclid, https://t5k.org/notes/proofs/infinite/, https://t5k.org/notes/proofs/infinite/euclids.html, https://t5k.org/notes/proofs/infinite/topproof.html, https://t5k.org/notes/proofs/infinite/goldbach.html, https://t5k.org/notes/proofs/infinite/kummers.html, https://t5k.org/notes/proofs/infinite/Saidak.html)), the maximal elements also may not exist, thus we are only interested on finding the minimal elements of these sets, and we define "minimal set" of a set as the set of the minimal elements of this set, under a given partially ordered binary relation (this binary relation is "is a subsequence of" in this project))

Two strings *x* and *y* are comparable (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparability, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComparableElements.html) if either *x* is a subsequence of *y*, or *y* is a subsequence of *x*. A surprising result from formal language theory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language_theory) is that **every set of pairwise incomparable strings is finite (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FiniteSet.html)** (which is proved by M. Lothaire), i.e. there are no infinite (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_set, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Infinite.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/InfiniteSet.html) antichains (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichain, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Antichain.html) for the subsequence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Subsequence.html) ordering (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartialOrder.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartiallyOrderedSet.html).

By the theorem that there are no infinite (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_set, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Infinite.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/InfiniteSet.html) antichains (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichain, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Antichain.html) (i.e. a subset of a partially ordered set such that any two distinct elements in the subset are incomparable (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparability, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComparableElements.html)) for the subsequence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Subsequence.html) ordering (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartialOrder.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartiallyOrderedSet.html) (i.e. the set of the minimal elements of any set under the subsequence ordering must be finite, even if this set is infinite, such as the set of the "prime numbers > *b*" strings in base *b* (for a given base *b* ≥ 2), for the proofs for that there are infinitely many primes, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_theorem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclidsTheorems.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#euclid, https://t5k.org/notes/proofs/infinite/, https://t5k.org/notes/proofs/infinite/euclids.html, https://t5k.org/notes/proofs/infinite/topproof.html, https://t5k.org/notes/proofs/infinite/goldbach.html, https://t5k.org/notes/proofs/infinite/kummers.html, https://t5k.org/notes/proofs/infinite/Saidak.html), there must be only finitely such minimal elements in every base *b*.

In this project, we want to find the set of the minimal strings of the "prime number > *b*" digit strings in bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36, since decimal (base 10) is not special in mathematics, there is no reason to only find this set in decimal (base 10), also, finding this set in decimal (base 10) is too easy to be researched in an article (only harder than bases 2, 3, 4, 6), thus it is necessary to research this set in other bases *b*.

Equivalently, a string *x* in a set of strings *S* is a minimal string if and only if any proper subsequence of *x* (subsequence of *x* which is unequal to *x*, like proper subset (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_subset, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ProperSubset.html)) is not in *S*.

The minimal set *M*(*L*) of a language (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FormalLanguage.html) *L* is interesting, this is because it allows us to compute two natural and related languages, defined as follows:

* *sub*(*L*) = {*x* ∈ Σ\* : there exists *y* ∈ *L* such that *x* is a subsequence of *y*}
* *sup*(*L*) = {*x* ∈ Σ\* : there exists *y* ∈ *L* such that *y* is a subsequence of *x*}

An amazing fact is that *sub*(*L*) and *sup*(*L*) are always regular. This follows from the classical theorem that every set of pairwise incomparable strings is finite, for the proof see https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021980069801110 (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_329.pdf).

Although the minimal set *M*(*L*) is necessary finite even for infinite set *L*, but computing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) the minimal set *M*(*L*) is undecidable (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Undecidable.html) in general and can be very difficult to compute even for simple languages, and can lead to some strange behaviour ...

The *OEIS* sequences for the base *b* representations of the prime numbers (of course, also includes the primes ≤ *b*) are: https://oeis.org/A004676 (*b* = 2), https://oeis.org/A001363 (*b* = 3), https://oeis.org/A004678 (*b* = 4), https://oeis.org/A004679 (*b* = 5), https://oeis.org/A004680 (*b* = 6), https://oeis.org/A004681 (*b* = 7), https://oeis.org/A004682 (*b* = 8), https://oeis.org/A004683 (*b* = 9), https://oeis.org/A000040 (*b* = 10), there are no *OEIS* sequences for *b* > 10 since *OEIS* disallows the alpha digits and only allows decimal characters (i.e. the 10 Arabic numerals (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_numerals, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArabicNumeral.html)), see https://oeis.org/wiki/Disallowed_sequences#Sequences_of_rational_integers_with_digits_other_than_0_to_9, but there is a short *OEIS* sequence https://oeis.org/A004684 for *b* = 11, which stops exactly before the first term with a nondecimal character (i.e. the prime 43, which is written "3A" in base *b* = 11) and stops with the prime 41, which is written "38" in base *b* = 11.

Some bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36 are notable: (fortunately, all of these bases except *b* = 36 are solved, except the primality proving for the probable prime 57<sub>62668</sub> in base *b* = 11 and the probable primes C5<sub>23755</sub>C, 80<sub>32017</sub>111, 95<sub>197420</sub>, A3<sub>592197</sub>A in base *b* = 13)

Addition (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Addition, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Addition.html) and multiplication (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Multiplication, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Multiplication.html) are the basic operations of arithmetic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Arithmetic, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Arithmetic.html) (which is also the basics of mathematics (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Mathematics, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Mathematics.html)). In the addition operation, the identity element (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/IdentityElement.html) is 0, and all natural numbers > 0 can be written as the sum of many 1's, and the number 1 cannot be broken up; in the multiplication operation, the identity element is 1, and all natural numbers > 1 can be written as the product of many prime numbers, and the prime numbers cannot be broken up. Also, primes are the natural numbers *n* > 1 such that if *n* divides (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divides, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Divides.html, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Divisor.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Factor, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Divides.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Divisor.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Divisible.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#divisor) *x*×*y* (*x* and *y* are natural numbers), then *n* divides either *x* or *y* (or both). Also, prime numbers are the natural numbers *n* such that the ring (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Ring.html) of integers modulo *n* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integers_modulo_n, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Mod.html) (i.e. the ring *Z*<sub>*n*</sub>) is a field (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Field.html) (also is a domain (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(ring_theory), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Domain.html), also is an integral domain (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_domain, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/IntegralDomain.html), also is a division ring (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_ring), also has no zero divisors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_divisor, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ZeroDivisor.html) other than 0 (for the special case that *n* = 1, it is the zero ring (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_ring, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TrivialRing.html))). Also, see https://t5k.org/ (The Prime Pages, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrimePages, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/The_Prime_Pages) and https://www.primegrid.com/ (Primegrid, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrimeGrid, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/PrimeGrid, https://t5k.org/bios/page.php?id=950) and http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm (the set of the primes) and http://www.numericana.com/answer/factoring.htm (factoring into primes). Besides, "the set of the minimal elements of the base *b* representations of the prime numbers > *b* under the subsequence ordering" to "the set of the prime numbers (except *b* itself) digit strings with length > 1 in base *b*" to "the partially ordered binary relation by subsequence" is "the set of the prime numbers" to "the set of the integers > 1" to "the partially ordered binary relation by divisibility" (and indeed, the "> 1" in "the prime numbers (except *b* itself) digit strings with length > 1 in base *b*" can be corresponded to the "> 1" in "the integers > 1") (for the reason why *b* itself is excluded (when *b* is prime, if *b* is composite, then there is no difference to include the *b* itself or not), see the sections below and https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=531632&postcount=7, the main reason is that *b* is the *only* prime ending with 0), thus the main problem in this project is very important and beautiful.

Also, the main problem in this project is hard and interesting, since the distribution of the primes are mysterious and almost completely random (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RandomNumber.html), and there is still no known formula of primes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_for_primes, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/FormulasForPrimes.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeFormulas.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Prime-GeneratingPolynomial.html, https://t5k.org/notes/faq/p_n.html, https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL8/Caldwell/caldwell78.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_210.pdf), https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL20/Toth2/toth32.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_211.pdf), https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1901/1901.01849.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_212.pdf)) which is efficiently computable (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency), but if the Riemann hypothesis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/RiemannHypothesis.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RiemannHypothesis.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/open.htm#rh) is true, then there is Mills' formula (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_for_primes#Mills'_formula, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mills%27_constant, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/MillsTheorem.html, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/MillsPrime.html, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/MillsConstant.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MillsTheorem.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MillsPrime.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MillsConstant.html, https://t5k.org/notes/proofs/A3n.html, https://t5k.org/notes/MillsConstant.html, https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1947-53-06/S0002-9904-1947-08849-2/S0002-9904-1947-08849-2.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_312.pdf), https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL8/Caldwell/caldwell78.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_210.pdf), https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL20/Toth2/toth32.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_211.pdf), https://oeis.org/A051254, https://oeis.org/A108739, https://oeis.org/A051021) *floor*(*A*<sup>3<sup>*n*</sup></sup>), which only gives prime numbers, also there is Wright's formula (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_for_primes#Wright's_formula, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.09741v3.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_218.pdf), https://oeis.org/A016104, https://oeis.org/A086238) *floor*(2<sup>2<sup>2<sup>...<sup>2<sup>*α*</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup>), which only gives prime numbers with no needing to assume Riemann hypothesis to be true, however, neither Mills' formula nor Wright's formula can be used to find primes, since both of these two formulas has no practical value (and neither the value of the *A* in Mills' formula nor the value of the *α* in Wright's formula is currently known), and there is no known way of calculating the constants in both of these two formulas without finding primes in the first place, another example of a formula which only gives prime numbers is a polynomial with 26 variables (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Variable.html) *a*, *b*, *c*, ..., *z* (exactly the 26 Latin letters (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_basic_Latin_alphabet)) and degree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_of_a_polynomial, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PolynomialDegree.html) 25, which is based on a system of Diophantine equations (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Diophantus.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiophantineEquation.html), this polynomial is (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_for_primes#Formula_based_on_a_system_of_Diophantine_equations and https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/MatijasevicPoly.html and https://web.archive.org/web/20120612174638/http://mathdl.maa.org/images/upload_library/22/Ford/JonesSatoWadaWiens.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_217.pdf)) (the variables *a*, *b*, *c*, ..., *z* must be nonnegative integers) (in fact, this polynomial can give negative nonprime numbers, such as −76, whose absolute value (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Absolute_value, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/AbsoluteValue.html) is not a prime, but all positive values given by this polynomial are primes):

2×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1, 2×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1, (*b*−1)×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1, (*b*−1)×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1, with *n* ≥ 1, for the same base *b* (of course, for some bases *b* the original minimal prime base *b* problem already covers finding the smallest prime of these forms, e.g. the original minimal prime base *b* problem covers finding the smallest prime of the form (*b*−1)×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1 if and only if *b*−1 is not prime, and the original minimal prime base *b* problem covers finding the smallest prime of the form (*b*−1)×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1 if and only if neither *b*−1 nor *b*−2 is prime, but I want the problem covers finding the smallest prime of these forms for *all* bases *b*)). The original minimal prime base *b* problem does not cover Conjectures 'R Us Sierpinski/Riesel conjectures base *b* with conjectured *k* (http://www.noprimeleftbehind.net/crus/tab/CRUS_tab.htm, https://www.rieselprime.de/Others/CRUS_tab.htm, https://web.archive.org/web/20230928115832/http://www.noprimeleftbehind.net/crus/vstats_new/all_ck_sierpinski.txt, https://web.archive.org/web/20230928115850/http://www.noprimeleftbehind.net/crus/vstats_new/all_ck_riesel.txt, https://www.mersenneforum.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=17598&d=1516910519, https://www.mersenneforum.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=17597&d=1516910519, https://web.archive.org/web/20221230035429/https://sites.google.com/site/robertgerbicz/sierpinski.txt, https://web.archive.org/web/20221230035558/https://sites.google.com/site/robertgerbicz/riesel.txt, https://www.mersenneforum.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=4557&d=1263456866, https://www.mersenneforum.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=4558&d=1263456995, https://www.mersenneforum.org/attachment.php?attachmentid=4415&d=1260969652, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=10910, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=25177) < *b*, since in Riesel side, the prime is not minimal prime in original definition if either *k*−1 or *b*−1 (or both) is prime, and in Sierpinski side, the prime is not minimal prime in original definition if *k* is prime (e.g. 25×30<sup>34205</sup>−1 is not minimal prime in base 30 in original definition, since it is OT<sub>34205</sub> in base 30, and T (= 29 in decimal) is prime, but it is minimal prime in base 30 if only primes > base are counted), but this extended version of minimal prime base *b* problem does.

**(warning: the data in the Table 5 in https://web.archive.org/web/20231011144408/https://www.utm.edu/staff/caldwell/preprints/2to100.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_3.pdf) has many errors, e.g. for base *b* = 53, *k* = 4 is remaining at *n* = 2500000 and *k* = 8 has first prime at *n* = 227183 (which should not be found when the article was written), but the table only lists {1816, 1838, 1862, 1892} for the "*k*s not yet eliminated" data for base *b* = 53, and for base *b* = 48, the correct "*k*s not yet eliminated" data (at *n* = 100000) is {29, 36, 62, 153, 561, 622, 701, 937, 1077, 1086, 1114, 1121, 1168}, but the table wrongly lists {29, 36, 62, 153, 422, 1174}, missing many *k* and wrongly includes *k* = 422 and *k* = 1174 (which are trivial *k* since *gcd*(*k*+1,48−1) for these two *k* are not 1), and for base *b* = 55, the correct "*k*s not yet eliminated" data (at *n* = 100000) is {36, 778, 2274}, but the table lists {1980, 2274}, this article allow *k* with partial or full algebraic factors to become the conjectures, thus the conjecture *k* for *b* = 55 in this article is 2500 instead of 4416 (which is the conjecture *k* for *b* = 55 in Conjectures 'R Us), and thus *k* = 3940 becomes a *k* > conjectured *k* and thus not considered, but the table still misses *k* = 36 and *k* = 778, and only includes *k* = 1980 = 36×55 (unlike Conjectures 'R Us, this article does not exclude the *k*s which are multiples of base (*b*) and where *k*+1 is composite))**

**(in fact, for any *k* (not only the *k* < *b*), there is always an *r* such that "the minimal prime in base *b*<sup>*r*</sup>" covers "finding the smallest prime of the form *k*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1 and *k*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1 and *b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*k* and *b*<sup>*n*</sup>−*k* (or proving that such prime does not exist)" (also, no matter what is the lower bound (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_bound, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LowerBound.html) of allowed *n*, the lower bound of allowed *n* need not to be 1 or 2), while this is not true for the original minimal prime problem (of course, there are bases *b* > 36 (which are not in this project) mentioned))**

However, including the base (*b*) itself results in automatic elimination of all possible extension numbers with "0 after 1" from the set (when the base is prime, if the base is composite, then there is no difference to include the base (*b*) itself or not), which is quite restrictive (since when the base is prime, then the base (*b*) itself is the only prime ending with 0, i.e. having trailing zero (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailing_zero), since in any base, all numbers ending with 0 (i.e. having trailing zero) are divisible by the base (*b*), thus cannot be prime unless it is equal the base (*b*), i.e. "10" in base *b*, note that the numbers cannot have leading zero (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_zero), since typically this is not the way we write numbers (in any base), thus for all primes in our sets (i.e. all primes > base (*b*)), all zero digits must be "between" other digits). (for the reference of this, see https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=531632&postcount=7)

Besides, this problem is better than the original minimal prime problem since this problem is regardless whether 1 is considered as prime or not, i.e. no matter 1 is considered as prime or not prime (https://t5k.org/notes/faq/one.html, https://primefan.tripod.com/Prime1ProCon.html, https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL15/Caldwell2/cald6.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_24.pdf), http://www.numericana.com/answer/numbers.htm#one), the sets in this problem are the same, while the sets in the original minimal prime problem are different, e.g. in base 10, if 1 is considered as prime, then the set in the original minimal prime problem is {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 89, 409, 449, 499, 6469, 6949, 9049, 9649, 9949, 60649, 666649, 946669, 60000049, 66000049, 66600049}, while if 1 is not considered as prime, then the set in the original minimal prime problem is {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 19, 41, 61, 89, 409, 449, 499, 881, 991, 6469, 6949, 9001, 9049, 9649, 9949, 60649, 666649, 946669, 60000049, 66000049, 66600049}, however, in base 10, the set in this problem is always {11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 227, 251, 257, 277, 281, 349, 409, 449, 499, 521, 557, 577, 587, 727, 757, 787, 821, 827, 857, 877, 881, 887, 991, 2087, 2221, 5051, 5081, 5501, 5581, 5801, 5851, 6469, 6949, 8501, 9001, 9049, 9221, 9551, 9649, 9851, 9949, 20021, 20201, 50207, 60649, 80051, 666649, 946669, 5200007, 22000001, 60000049, 66000049, 66600049, 80555551, 555555555551, 5000000000000000000000000000027}, no matter 1 is considered as prime or not prime.

The third reason for excluding the single-digit primes is that they are trivial (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triviality_(mathematics), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Trivial.html), like that Conjectures 'R Us Sierpinski/Riesel conjectures base *b* requires exponent *n* ≥ 1 for these primes (see https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=447679&postcount=27), *n* = 0 is not acceptable to avoid the trivial primes (e.g. 2×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1, 4×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1, 6×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1, 10×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1, 12×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1, 16×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1, 3×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1, 4×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1, 6×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1, 8×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1, 12×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1, 14×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1, ... cannot be quickly eliminated with *n* = 0, or the conjectures become much easier and uninteresting), for the same reason, this minimal prime puzzle requires ≥ *b* (i.e. ≥ 2 digits) for these primes, single-digit primes are not acceptable to avoid the trivial primes (e.g. families containing digit 2, 3, 5, 7, B, D, H, J, N, T, V, ... cannot be quickly eliminated with the single-digit prime, or the conjectures become much easier and uninteresting).

The fourth reason for excluding the primes ≤ *b* is that starting with *b*+1 makes the formula of the number of possible (first digit,last digit) combo of a minimal prime in base *b* more simple and smooth number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SmoothNumber.html, https://oeis.org/A003586, https://oeis.org/A051037, https://oeis.org/A002473, https://oeis.org/A051038, https://oeis.org/A080197, https://oeis.org/A080681, https://oeis.org/A080682, https://oeis.org/A080683) (i.e. the greatest prime factor (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GreatestPrimeFactor.html, https://oeis.org/A006530) is small), it is (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*) (https://oeis.org/A062955), where *eulerphi* is Euler's totient function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/EulersPhi.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TotientFunction.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/modular.htm#phi, http://www.javascripter.net/math/calculators/eulertotientfunction.htm, https://oeis.org/A000010), since *b*−1 is the number of possible first digit (except 0, all digits can be first digit), and *eulerphi*(*b*) is the number of possible last digit (only digits coprime to *b* can be last digit), by rule of product (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_product), there are (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*) possible (first digit,last digit) combo, and if start with *b*, then when *b* is prime, there is an additional possible (first digit,last digit) combo: (1,0), and hence the formula will be (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)+1 if *b* is prime, or (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*) if *b* is composite (the fully formula will be (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)+*isprime*(*b*) or (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)+*floor*((*b*−*eulerphi*(*b*)) / (*b*−1))), which is more complex, and if start with 1 (i.e. the original minimal prime problem), the formula is much more complex, since the prime digits (i.e. the single-digit primes) should be excluded, and (for such prime > *b*) the first digit has *b*−1−*primepi*(*b*) choices, and the last digit has *eulerphi*(*b*)−*primepi*(*b*)+*omega*(*b*) (https://oeis.org/A048864) choices, by the rule of product (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_product), there are (*b*−1−*primepi*(*b*))×(*eulerphi*(*b*)−*primepi*(*b*)+*omega*(*b*)) choices of the (first digit,last digit) combo (if for such prime ≥ *b* instead of > *b*, then the formula will be (*b*−1−*primepi*(*b*))×(*eulerphi*(*b*)−*primepi*(*b*)+*omega*(*b*))+1 if *b* is prime, or (*b*−1−*primepi*(*b*))×(*eulerphi*(*b*)−*primepi*(*b*)+*omega*(*b*)) if *b* is composite), which is much more complex, (also, the possible (first digit,last digit) combo for a prime > *b* in base *b* are exactly the (first digit,last digit) combos which there are infinitely many primes have, while this is not true when the requiring is prime ≥ *b* or prime ≥ 2 instead of prime > *b*, since this will contain the prime factors of *b*, which are not coprime to *b* and hence there is only this prime (and not infinitely many primes) have this (first digit,last digit) combo) thus the main problem in this project (i.e. the minimal prime (start with *b*+1) problem) is much better than the original minimal prime problem.

(in the section above, *isprime*(*n*) is the characteristic function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CharacteristicFunction.html) of primes (i.e. 1 if *n* is prime, else 0) (https://oeis.org/A010051), *floor* is the floor function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_function, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/FloorFunction.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Floor_function, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FloorFunction.html), *primepi* is the prime-counting function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime-counting_function, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/PrimeCountingFunction.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeCountingFunction.html, https://oeis.org/A000720, https://oeis.org/A006880, https://oeis.org/A007053, https://faculty.lynchburg.edu/~nicely/index.html, https://faculty.lynchburg.edu/~nicely/pi/pix_0000.htm, https://faculty.lynchburg.edu/~nicely/pi/pix_0001.htm, https://faculty.lynchburg.edu/~nicely/constell.zip, http://sweet.ua.pt/tos/primes.html, https://pzktupel.de/counting/PI_01.php, https://sweet.ua.pt/tos/bib/5.4.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_452.pdf), https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.01839.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_453.pdf)), *omega* is the little prime omega function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_omega_function, https://oeis.org/A001221))

The fifth reason (and the main reason) for excluding the primes ≤ *b* is that the possible last digits of a minimal prime in base *b* are exactly the last digits in base *b* such that there are infinitely many primes, by the Dirichlet's theorem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet%27s_theorem_on_arithmetic_progressions, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/DirichletsTheorem.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DirichletsTheorem.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#dirichlet), thus in this problem, we completely need not to consider the last digits which are not coprime (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/RelativelyPrime.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Coprime, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RelativelyPrime.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#coprime) to *b*, while in the original minimal prime problem, this is false for the primes dividing *b*.

The sixth reason is that (heuristically) the more one-digit primes are contained in the set, the less primes have to be considered (since all numbers that contain one of these digits cannot be contained in the minimal set), thus one-digit primes will make this problem much easier and more uninteresting (and when single-digit primes are excluded, all base *b* digits may appear in large minimal primes in base *b*, e.g. when base *b* = 19 searched to length 100000, all base 19 digits except 2 and 8 still appear in the list of the 23 unsolved families), the reason is the same as why the article https://nntdm.net/papers/nntdm-25/NNTDM-25-1-036-047.pdf deals only with the minimal sets for *eulerphi*(*n*) + *k* (where *eulerphi* is the Euler's totient function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/EulersPhi.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TotientFunction.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/modular.htm#phi, http://www.javascripter.net/math/calculators/eulertotientfunction.htm, https://oeis.org/A000010)) with *k* ≤ 5, since for *k* = 6, *eulerphi*(*n*) + 6 contains only two one-digit numbers (the author of that article wishes that the problem become easier, while I wish that this problem become much harder, thus I exclude the single-digit primes).

The seventh reason is that in this problem, for the linear families *x*{*y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *y* is a digit in base *b*) in base *b* which we search, *y* can be any base *b* digit except 1 (*y* can be 1 if and only if base *b* has no repunit primes), while in the original minimal prime problem, *y* cannot be any prime digit (and *y* can be 1 if and only if base *b* has no repunit primes).

The eighth reason is that for the numbers in the sets in this problem, the greatest common divisor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GreatestCommonDivisor.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/numbers.htm#gcd) of the digits of these numbers must be 1, and the last digit must be coprime (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/RelativelyPrime.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Coprime, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RelativelyPrime.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#coprime) to the base (*b*), since a prime *p* (when written in base *b*) have both "greatest common divisor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GreatestCommonDivisor.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/numbers.htm#gcd) of the digits of these numbers is 1" and "last digit is coprime (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/RelativelyPrime.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Coprime, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RelativelyPrime.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#coprime) to the base (*b*)" if and only if *p* > *b*, thus it is not true for the numbers in the sets in the original minimal prime problem.

The minimal elements (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_element) of the set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Set.html) of the prime numbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Prime.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Prime, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumber.html,

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Radix.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Base, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Radix.html) *b* under the subsequence

https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartialOrder.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartiallyOrderedSet.html) is interesting because all prime numbers > *b* in base *b* except the repunits (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repunit, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_repunit_primes, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Repunit.html, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/GeneralizedRepunitPrime.html,

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)) (or digits (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_digit, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Digit, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Digit.html)), since if a repdigit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repdigit, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Repdigit.html, https://oeis.org/A010785) in base *b* is a prime > *b*, then is must be a repunit (i.e. the repeating digit is 1) in base *b*, since, for example, the repdigit 77777 is divisible by 7, in any base *b* > 7, also, since a repunit prime in base *b* is a minimal prime in base *b* if and only if it is the smallest repunit prime in base *b*, thus if there exists a repunit prime in base *b*, then there is exactly one repunit prime in base *b* which is also a minimal prime in base *b*, thus if there exists a repunit prime in base *b*, then all but one minimal primes in base *b* contain at least two different digits, and if there does not exist a repunit prime in base *b*, then all minimal primes in base *b* contain at least two different digits.  

In fact, I create this problem because I think that the single-digit primes are trivial (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triviality_(mathematics), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Trivial.html) (like strictly non-palindromic number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strictly_non-palindromic_number, http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath359.htm, https://oeis.org/A016038), single-digit numbers are trivially palindromic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_prime, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/PalindromicPrime.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PalindromicNumber.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PalindromicPrime.html, https://www.numbersaplenty.com/set/palindromic_number/, https://t5k.org/top20/page.php?id=53, https://t5k.org/primes/search.php?Comment=Palindrome&OnList=all&Number=1000000&Style=HTML, https://oeis.org/A002113, https://oeis.org/A002385), thus to test whether a number *n* is strictly non-palindromic, we do not consider the bases *b* > *n*, since in these bases, *n* is a single-digit number, thus trivially palindromic, note that all strictly non-palindromic numbers > 6 are primes), thus I do not count them. (There is someone else who also exclude the single-digit primes, but his research is about substring (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substring) instead of subsequence, see https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=235383&postcount=42, subsequences can contain consecutive elements which were not consecutive in the original sequence, a subsequence which consists of a consecutive run of elements from the original sequence, such as 234 from 123456, is a substring, substring is a refinement of the subsequence, subsequence is a generalization of substring, substring must be subsequence, but subsequence may not be substring, 514 is a subsequence of 352148, but not a substring of 352148, see the list below of the comparation of "subsequence" and "substring")

The longest common subsequence problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence) and the longest common substring problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_substring) are two hard problems on strings (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/String.html), the former is NP-complete (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NP-CompleteProblem.html) and NP-hard (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hard, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NP-HardProblem.html), while the latter is not.

(we do not research substring in this project, because for substring ordering, "the set of the minimal elements of the base 10 representations of the prime numbers > 10" are very likely to be infinite (and thus almost unsolvable), since all primes of the form 1{0}3 (i.e. https://oeis.org/A159352, for the exponents see https://oeis.org/A049054, also see https://stdkmd.net/nrr/1/10003.htm) or 3{0}1 (i.e. https://oeis.org/A259866, for the exponents see https://oeis.org/A056807, also see https://stdkmd.net/nrr/3/30001.htm) are minimal elements of the base 10 representations of the prime numbers > 10 under the substring ordering, and there is likely infinitely many primes of the form 1{0}3 and infinitely many primes of the form 3{0}1, see https://web.archive.org/web/20100628035147/http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/98/exp_primes and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Archives/Mathematics/2023_September_25#Are_there_infinitely_many_primes_of_the_form_1000%E2%80%A60007,_333%E2%80%A63331,_7111%E2%80%A6111,_or_3444%E2%80%A64447_in_base_10? and https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07894.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_203.pdf) and https://web.archive.org/web/20231002020455/http://yves.gallot.pagesperso-orange.fr/papers/weight.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_216.pdf) and https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=564786&postcount=3 and https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=461665&postcount=7 and https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=354505&postcount=5 and https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=344985&postcount=293 and https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=625978&postcount=1027, https://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=5093&nowrap=true#66471 and https://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=4935&nowrap=true#63813)

It is found that both "number of minimal primes base *b*" and "length of the largest minimal prime base *b*" are roughly (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis,

natural logarithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/e.html, https://oeis.org/A001113), *γ* = 0.577215664901 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_constant, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Gamma.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Euler-MascheroniConstant.html, https://oeis.org/A001620), *eulerphi* is Euler's totient function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/EulersPhi.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TotientFunction.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/modular.htm#phi, http://www.javascripter.net/math/calculators/eulertotientfunction.htm, https://oeis.org/A000010), you can see the condensed table for bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36 in the bottom of this article, *e*<sup>*γ*×(*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)</sup> is an exponential sequence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExponentialGrowth.html) for (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*) (https://oeis.org/A062955), and since (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*) has polynomial growth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Polynomial.html) for *b* (since it is always between *b*−1 and *b*<sup>2</sup>), thus *e*<sup>*γ*×(*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)</sup> has exponential growth for *b*, and "largest minimal prime base *b*" is roughly *b*<sup>*e*<sup>*γ*×(*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)</sup></sup>, which has double exponential growth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_exponential_function) for *b*, however, for bases *b* = 7 and *b* = 15, the estimation of "length of the largest minimal prime base *b*" is much higher than the real value, since these two bases are very-high Nash weight (https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Nash_weight, http://irvinemclean.com/maths/nash.htm, http://www.brennen.net/primes/ProthWeight.html,

The value (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*) (https://oeis.org/A062955) is the number of possible (first digit,last digit) (also called (initial digit,final digit)) combos (ordered pair (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrderedPair.html)) of a minimal prime in base *b* (these (first digit,last digit) combos are also all possible (first digit,last digit) combos (ordered pair (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrderedPair.html)) of a prime > *b* in base *b*) (these (first digit,last digit) combos for decimal (base *b* = 10) are listed in *OEIS* sequence https://oeis.org/A085820, except the single-digit numbers (i.e. 1, 3, 7, 9) (i.e. first digit is 0, and hence the number has leading zeros (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_zero)) in this sequence, the smallest primes with these (first digit,last digit) combos listed in https://oeis.org/A085820 (except the single-digit numbers (i.e. 1, 3, 7, 9) in this sequence) are (*italic* for primes which are not minimal primes): 11, 13, 17, 19, *211*, 23, 227, 29, 31, *313*, 37, 349, 41, 43, 47, 409, 521, 53, *547*, 59, 61, *613*, 67, *619*, 71, 73, 727, 79, *811*, 83, 827, 89, *911*, *953*, 97, *919*, and the smallest minimal primes with these (first digit,last digit) combos listed in https://oeis.org/A085820 (except the single-digit numbers (i.e. 1, 3, 7, 9) in this sequence) are (0 if no such minimal prime exists): 11, 13, 17, 19, 251, 23, 227, 29, 31, 0, 37, 349, 41, 43, 47, 409, 521, 53, 557, 59, 61, 0, 67, 6469, 71, 73, 727, 79, 821, 83, 827, 89, 991, 0, 97, 9049) (they are only all "possible" (first digit,last digit) combos (ordered pair (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrderedPair.html)) of a minimal prime in base *b*, this does not mean that they must be realized, e.g. there are no minimal primes with (first digit,last digit) = (2,2) in base *b* = 3, and there are no minimal primes with (first digit,last digit) = (3,3), (6,3), or (9,3) in base *b* = 10, but it is conjectured that there are only finitely many such examples (i.e. for every sufficiently large (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufficiently_large, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SufficientlyLarge.html) base *b*, for any given such (first digit,last digit) combo, there is a minimal prime with this (first digit,last digit) combo), also, it is conjectured that all such examples have *gcd*(first digit, last digit, *b*−1) > 1 (i.e. there is a prime number which divides first digit, last digit, and *b*−1 simultaneously), since the first digit has *b*−1 choices (all digits except 0 can be the first digit), and the last digit has *eulerphi*(*b*) choices (only digits coprime (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/RelativelyPrime.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Coprime, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RelativelyPrime.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#coprime) to *b* (i.e. the digits in the reduced residue system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_residue_system, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ReducedResidueSystem.html) mod *b*) can be the last digit), by the rule of product (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_product), there are (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*) choices of the (first digit,last digit) combo.

It is extremely likely that the largest minimal prime in base *b* is larger than the currently largest known prime (the world record prime) (i.e. 2<sup>82589933</sup>−1, with 24862048 decimal digits) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_known_prime_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LargePrime.html, https://t5k.org/largest.html, https://t5k.org/top20/page.php?id=3, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#history, https://t5k.org/primes/page.php?id=125874, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/M51, http://factordb.com/index.php?id=1100000001257221107&open=prime, https://oeis.org/A344984), for bases *b* = 19, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, i.e. they will broke the world record (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record) like *Guinness World Records* (https://guinnessworldrecords.com/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records), similar example is the project "Do You Feel Lucky?" (https://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=8422) in PrimeGrid (https://www.primegrid.com/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrimeGrid, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/PrimeGrid, https://t5k.org/bios/page.php?id=950), which searches primes of the form *b*<sup>2<sup>22</sup></sup>+1 for bases *b* ≥ 846398, such primes will be larger than the currently largest known prime (the world record prime) (i.e. 2<sup>82589933</sup>−1, with 24862048 decimal digits) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_known_prime_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LargePrime.html, https://t5k.org/largest.html, https://t5k.org/top20/page.php?id=3, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#history, https://t5k.org/primes/page.php?id=125874, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/M51, http://factordb.com/index.php?id=1100000001257221107&open=prime, https://oeis.org/A344984).

We can imagine an alien force, vastly more powerful than us, landing on Earth and demanding the set of all minimal primes in base *b* = 17 (or 21, 26, 36) (including primality proving of all primes in this set) or they will destroy our planet. In that case, I claim, we should marshal all our computers and all our mathematicians and attempt to find the set and to prove the primality of all numbers in this set. But suppose, instead, that they ask for the set of all minimal primes in base *b* = 19 (or 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35). In that case, I believe, we should attempt to destroy the aliens. **(Maybe only the God knows the set of all minimal primes in base *b* = 19 (or 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35)!)** (just like Paul Erdős for the Ramsey numbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RamseyNumber.html), I do not think that finding the set of all minimal primes in bases *b* = 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 is easier than finding the Ramsey numbers *R*(*m*,*n*) for *m* > 4, *n* > 4)

This problem covers finding the smallest prime in these families in the same base *b* (or proving that such prime does not exist), since the smallest prime in these families (if exists) **must** be a minimal prime in base *b* (since these families are of the form {*x*}, *x*{*y*}, {*x*}*y*, *x*{0}*y* (where *x* and *y* are any digits in base *b*) in base *b*, and the repeating digit is not 1 for all bases *b* > 2 (or all bases *b* > 3 for the family (*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1)/2 for odd *b*) except the family (*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1)/(*b*−1), which is the form {1}) (thus the main problem in this project covers finding the smallest prime in these families (or proving that such prime does not exist) in bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36, since all bases *b* < "smallest allowed *b*" (i.e. the bases *b* < *k*+1 for the families of the form *k*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>±1 with fixed 2 ≤ *k* ≤ 12 and the families of the form *b*<sup>*n*</sup>±*k* with fixed 2 ≤ *k* ≤ 4) either have a prime < 2×10<sup>17</sup> (only count the numbers > *b*) or can be proven to have no primes (only count the numbers > *b*), the largest of the smallest prime in these families is 11×8<sup>18</sup>−1 = 198158383604301823, which is the smallest prime of the form 11×8<sup>*n*</sup>−1 with *n* ≥ 1): (while the original minimal prime problem does not cover some of these forms for some bases (or all bases) *b*)

**(of course, there are bases *b* > 36 (which are not in this project) mentioned in the "smaller bases *b* such that this family can be ruled out as only containing composites (only count the numbers > *b*) (by covering congruence, algebraic factorization, or combine of them)<br>bases *b*: why this family contain no primes > *b*" column and the "smaller bases *b* with the smallest (probable) prime in this family has length > 100: *b* (*length*)" column, but I will not run the bases *b* > 36 in the main problem in this project, since base 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36 are the bases which the main problem in this project decide to go, and you can also try to extend the main problem in this project to bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 50 or 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 100 (I cannot imagine the effort needed for bases *b* around 500 or 1000, even if strong probable primes are allowed) (in fact, the *GMP* (https://gmplib.org/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library) program supports bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 50, but I only ran for bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36) (suggestion to use the character ":" to saparate the digits for bases *b* > 36 (and just use decimal to write the digits), just like https://baseconvert.com/ and https://baseconvert.com/high-precision), but warning: these problems will be extremely hard (especially the bases *b* such that (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*) (https://oeis.org/A062955) is larger)!!! The difficulty of base *b* is roughly (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/AsymptoticallyEqual.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Asymptotic.html) *e*<sup>*γ*×(*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)</sup>, and *e*<sup>*γ*×(*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)</sup> is an exponential sequence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExponentialGrowth.html) for (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*) (https://oeis.org/A062955))**

**(in fact, I know exactly which bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 1024 have the families listed in the table below as unsolved families, all these families in all bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 1024 have been searched to length ≥ 10000)**

In this case we can write *p* = *x*1. If *x* contains 1, 3, 4, 6, or 7, then (respectively) **11** ◁ *p*, **31** ◁ *p*, **41** ◁ *p*, **61** ◁ *p*, or **71** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *x* are 0, 2, 5, 8, or 9.

Case 1.1: *p* begins with 2.

In this case we can write *p* = 2*y*1. If 5 ◁ *y*, then **251** ◁ *p*. If 8 ◁ *y*, then **281** ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *y*, then 29 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0 or 2.

If 22 ◁ *y*, then **2221** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* contains zero or one 2's.

If *y* contains no 2's, then *p* ∈ 2{0}1. But then, since the sum of the digits of *p* is 3, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime.

If *y* contains exactly one 2, then we can write *p* = 2*z*2*w*1, where *z*,*w* ∈ {0}. If 0 ◁ *z* and 0 ◁ *w*, then **20201** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume either *z* or *w* is empty.

If *z* is empty, then *p* ∈ 22{0}1, and the smallest prime *p* ∈ 22{0}1 is **22000001**.

If *w* is empty, then *p* ∈ 2{0}21, and the smallest prime *p* ∈ 2{0}21 is **20021**.

Case 1.2: *p* begins with 5.

In this case we can write *p* = 5*y*1. If 2 ◁ *y*, then **521** ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *y*, then 59 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0, 5, or 8.

If 05 ◁ *y*, then **5051** ◁ *p*. If 08 ◁ *y*, then **5081** ◁ *p*. If 50 ◁ *y*, then **5501** ◁ *p*. If 58 ◁ *y*, then **5581** ◁ *p*. If 80 ◁ *y*, then **5801** ◁ *p*. If 85 ◁ *y*, then **5851** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* ∈ {0} ∪ {5} ∪ {8}.

If *y* ∈ {0}, then *p* ∈ 5{0}1. But then, since the sum of the digits of *p* is 6, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime.

If *y* ∈ {5}, then *p* ∈ 5{5}1 = {5}1, and the smallest prime *p* ∈ 5{5}1 = {5}1 is **555555555551**.

If *y* ∈ {8}, since if 88 ◁ *y*, then 881 ◁ *p*, hence we may assume *y* ∈ {*𝜆*, 8}, and thus *p* ∈ {51, 581}, but 51 and 581 are both composite.

Case 1.3: *p* begins with 8.

In this case we can write p = 8*y*1. If 2 ◁ *y*, then **821** ◁ *p*. If 8 ◁ *y*, then **881** ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *y*, then 89 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0 or 5.

If 50 ◁ *y*, then **8501** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume y ∈ {0}{5}.

If 005 ◁ *y*, then **80051** ◁ p. Hence we may assume y ∈ {0} ∪ {5} ∪ 0{5}.

If *y* ∈ {0}, then *p* ∈ 8{0}1. But then, since the sum of the digits of *p* is 9, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime.

If *y* ∈ {5}, since if 55555555555 ◁ *y*, then 555555555551 ◁ *p*, hence we may assume *y* ∈ {*𝜆*, 5, 55, 555, 5555, 55555, 555555, 5555555, 55555555, 555555555, 5555555555}, and thus *p* ∈ {81, 851, 8551, 85551, 855551, 8555551, 85555551, 855555551, 8555555551, 85555555551, 855555555551}, but all of these numbers are composite.

If *y* ∈ 0{5}, since if 55555555555 ◁ *y*, then 555555555551 ◁ *p*, hence we may assume *y* ∈ {0, 05, 055, 0555, 05555, 055555, 0555555, 05555555, 055555555, 0555555555, 05555555555}, and thus *p* ∈ {801, 8051, 80551, 805551, 8055551, 80555551, 805555551, 8055555551, 80555555551, 805555555551, 8055555555551}, and of these numbers only 80555551 and 8055555551 are primes, but 80555551 ◁ 8055555551, thus only **80555551** is minimal prime.

Case 1.4: *p* begins with 9.

In this case we can write p = 9*y*1. If 9 ◁ *y*, then **991** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0, 2, 5, or 8.

If 00 ◁ *y*, then **9001** ◁ *p*. If 22 ◁ *y*, then **9221** ◁ *p*. If 55 ◁ *y*, then **9551** ◁ *p*. If 88 ◁ *y*, then 881 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* contains at most one 0, at most one 2, at most one 5, and at most one 8.

If *y* only contains at most one 0 and does not contain any of {2, 5, 8}, then *y* ∈ {*𝜆*, 0}, and thus *p* ∈ {91, 901}, but 91 and 901 are both composite. If *y* only contains at most one 0 and only one of {2, 5, 8}, then the sum of the digits of *p* is divisible by 3, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime. Hence we may assume *y* contains at least two of {2, 5, 8}.

If 25 ◁ *y*, then 251 ◁ *p*. If 28 ◁ *y*, then 281 ◁ *p*. If 52 ◁ *y*, then 521 ◁ *p*. If 82 ◁ *y*, then 821 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* contains no 2's (since if *y* contains 2, then *y* cannot contain either 5's or 8's, which is a contradiction).

If 85 ◁ *y*, then **9851** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* ∈ {58, 580, 508, 058}, and thus *p* ∈ {9581, 95801, 95081, 90581}, and of these numbers only 95801 is prime, but 95801 is not minimal prime since 5801 ◁ 95801.

Case 2: *p* ends with 3.

In this case we can write p = *x*3. If *x* contains 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8, then (respectively) **13** ◁ *p*, **23** ◁ *p*, **43** ◁ *p*, **53** ◁ *p*, **73** ◁ *p*, or **83** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *x* are 0, 3, 6, or 9, and thus all digits of *p* are 0, 3, 6, or 9. But then, since the digits of *p* all have a common factor 3, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime.

Case 3: *p* ends with 7.

In this case we can write *p* = *x*7. If *x* contains 1, 3, 4, 6, or 9, then (respectively) **17** ◁ *p*, **37** ◁ *p*, **47** ◁ *p*, **67** ◁ *p*, or **97** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *x* are 0, 2, 5, 7, or 8.

Case 3.1: *p* begins with 2.

In this case we can write *p* = 2*y*7. If 2 ◁ *y*, then **227** ◁ *p*. If 5 ◁ *y*, then **257** ◁ *p*. If 7 ◁ *y*, then **277** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0 or 8.

If 08 ◁ *y*, then **2087** ◁ *p*. If 88 ◁ *y*, then 887 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* ∈ {0} ∪ 8{0}.

If *y* ∈ {0}, then *p* ∈ 2{0}7. But then, since the sum of the digits of *p* is 9, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime.

If y ∈ 8{0}, then *p* ∈ 28{0}7. But then *p* is divisible by 7, since for *n* ≥ 0 we have 7 × 40<sub>*n*</sub>1 = 280<sub>*n*</sub>7, so *p* cannot be prime.

Case 3.2: *p* begins with 5.

In this case we can write *p* = 5*y*7. If 5 ◁ *y*, then **557** ◁ *p*. If 7 ◁ *y*, then **577** ◁ *p*. If 8 ◁ *y*, then **587** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0 or 2.

If 22 ◁ *y*, then 227 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* contains zero or one 2's.

If *y* contains no 2's, then *p* ∈ 5{0}7. But then, since the sum of the digits of *p* is 12, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime.

If *y* contains exactly one 2, then we can write *p* = 5*z*2*w*7, where *z*,*w* ∈ {0}. If 0 ◁ *z* and 0 ◁ *w*, then **50207** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume either *z* or *w* is empty.

If *z* is empty, then *p* ∈ 52{0}7, and the smallest prime *p* ∈ 52{0}7 is **5200007**.

If *w* is empty, then *p* ∈ 5{0}27, and the smallest prime *p* ∈ 5{0}27 is **5000000000000000000000000000027**.

Case 3.3: *p* begins with 7.

In this case we can write *p* = 7*y*7. If 2 ◁ *y*, then **727** ◁ *p*. If 5 ◁ *y*, then **757** ◁ *p*. If 8 ◁ *y*, then **787** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0 or 7, and thus all digits of *p* are 0 or 7. But then, since the digits of *p* all have a common factor 7, *p* is divisible by 7, so *p* cannot be prime.

Case 3.4: *p* begins with 8.

In this case we can write *p* = 8*y*7. If 2 ◁ *y*, then **827** ◁ *p*. If 5 ◁ *y*, then **857** ◁ *p*. If 7 ◁ *y*, then **877** ◁ *p*. If 8 ◁ *y*, then **887** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* ∈ {0}, and thus *p* ∈ 8{0}7. But then, since the sum of the digits of *p* is 15, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime.

Case 4: *p* ends with 9.

In this case we can write *p* = *x*9. If *x* contains 1, 2, 5, 7, or 8, then (respectively) **19** ◁ *p*, **29** ◁ *p*, **59** ◁ *p*, **79** ◁ *p*, or **89** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *x* are 0, 3, 4, 6, or 9.

If 44 ◁ *x*, then **449** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *x* contains zero or one 4's.

If x contains no 4's, then all digits of *x* are 0, 3, 6, or 9, and thus all digits of *p* are 0, 3, 6, or 9. But then, since the digits of *p* all have a common factor 3, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime. Hence we may assume that *x* contains exactly one 4.

Case 4.1: *p* begins with 3.

In this case we can write *p* = 3*y*4*z*9, where all digits of *y*, *z* are 0, 3, 6, or 9. We must have **349** ◁ *p*.

Case 4.2: *p* begins with 4.

In this case we can write *p* = 4*y*9, where all digits of *y* are 0, 3, 6, or 9. If 0 ◁ *y*, then **409** ◁ *p*. If 3 ◁ *y*, then 43 ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *y*, then **499** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* ∈ {6}, and thus *p* ∈ 4{6}9. But then *p* is divisible by 7, since for *n* ≥ 0 we have 7 × 6<sub>*n*</sub>7 = 46<sub>*n*</sub>9, so *p* cannot be prime.

Case 4.3: *p* begins with 6.

In this case we can write p = 6*y*4*z*9, where all digits of *y*, *z* are 0, 3, 6, or 9. If 0 ◁ *z*, then 409 ◁ *p*. If 3 ◁ *z*, then 43 ◁ *p*. If 6 ◁ *z*, then **6469** ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *z*, then 499 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *z* is empty.

If 3 ◁ *y*, then 349 ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *y*, then **6949** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0 or 6.

If 06 ◁ *y*, then **60649** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* ∈ {6}{0}.

If 666 ◁ *y*, then **666649** ◁ *p*. If 00000 ◁ *y*, then **60000049** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* ∈ {*𝜆*, 0, 00, 000, 0000, 6, 60, 600, 6000, 60000, 66, 660, 6600, 66000, 660000}, and thus *p* ∈ {649, 6049, 60049, 600049, 6000049, 6649, 66049, 660049, 6600049, 66000049, 66649, 666049, 6660049, 66600049, 666000049}, and of these numbers only **66000049** and **66600049** are primes.

Case 4.4: *p* begins with 9.

In this case we can write p = 9*y*4*z*9, where all digits of *y*, *z* are 0, 3, 6, or 9. If 0 ◁ *y*, then **9049** ◁ *p*. If 3 ◁ *y*, then 349 ◁ *p*. If 6 ◁ *y*, then **9649** ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *y*, then **9949** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* is empty.

If 0 ◁ *z*, then 409 ◁ *p*. If 3 ◁ *z*, then 43 ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *z*, then 499 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *z* ∈ {6}, and thus *p* ∈ 94{6}9, and the smallest prime *p* ∈ 94{6}9 is 946669.

I left as an exercise to the readers to write the proof for bases *b* = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 18 (bases *b* = 14 and *b* = 18 have 650 and 549 minimal primes, respectively, they are "a little" many, thus they are "a little" difficult, but you may try them!) like http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Papers/minimal5.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_11.pdf) for base *b* = 10 and https://scholar.colorado.edu/downloads/hh63sw661 (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_16.pdf) for bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 10 **(warning: the datas for bases 8 and 10 have errors, the data for base 8 misses the prime 6101 and the data for base 10 misses the primes 9001 and 9049 and instead wrongly includes the primes 90001, 90469, and 9000049, and the correct values of *S*<sub>***m***</sub> for bases 8 and 10 are 15 and 26 (instead of 14 and 27), respectively, also, the "number of minimal primes base *b*" and the "length of the largest minimal prime base *b*" are not the same sizes of *b* but the same sizes of *e*<sup>*γ*×(*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)</sup>, this article has this error is because it only search bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 10, and for the data of 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 10 for the original minimal problem, you may think that they are the same sizes of *b* (however, if you extend the data to *b* = 11, 13, 16, then you will know that they are not the same sizes of *b*), since bases *b* = 7 and *b* = 9 have very large differences of the "number of minimal primes base *b*" between the original minimal problem and this new minimal prime problem (*b* = 7: 9 v.s. 71, *b* = 9: 12 v.s. 151), and bases *b* = 5 and *b* = 8 and *b* = 9 have very large differences of the "length of the largest minimal prime base *b*" between the original minimal problem and this new minimal prime problem (*b* = 5: 5 v.s. 96, *b* = 8: 9 v.s. 221, *b* = 9: 4 v.s. 1161))** for the original minimal prime problems, of course, the proof for base *b* = 2 is trivial, since all primes *p* > 2 must start and end with 1 in base 2, thus we must have 11 ◁ *p*, however, for some bases *b* like 24 (the currently "proven" base *b* (including the primality proving for the primes in the set) with the most number of minimal primes) and 22 (the currently "proven" base *b* (if unproven probable primes are allowed) with the most number of minimal primes), it is almost impossible to write the proof by hand, since base *b* = 24 and *b* = 22 have too many (3409 and 8003, respectively) minimal primes to write the proof (not to mention the "extremely hard" unproven bases *b*, i.e. bases *b* = 19, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, you will write the proof (up to the unsolved families) until the end of time!), thus the C++ program code (for computer to compute (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) the proof) is made.

Any repunit in any base *b* having a composite number of digits is necessarily composite. Only repunits (in any base *b*) having a prime number of digits might be prime. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition, e.g. 11111111111111111111111111111111111 (the repunit with 35 (= 5 × 7, which is composite) digits) = 11111 × 1000010000100001000010000100001 = 1111111 × 10000001000000100000010000001, since 35 = 5 × 7 = 7 × 5, and this repunit factorization does not depend on the base *b* in which the repunit is expressed. (note that the value of the repunit (in any base *b*) having 1 digit is 1, and 1 is not prime (https://t5k.org/notes/faq/one.html, https://primefan.tripod.com/Prime1ProCon.html, https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL15/Caldwell2/cald6.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_24.pdf), http://www.numericana.com/answer/numbers.htm#one)).

A repunit (in any base *b*) with length *n* can be prime only if *n* is prime, since otherwise *b*<sup>*k*×*m*</sup>−1 is a binomial number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinomialNumber.html) which can be factored algebraically (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Factorization&oldid=1143370673#Factoring_other_polynomials, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PolynomialFactorization.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/factoring.htm#special, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/repunit/repunitnote.htm#repunit_factorization, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/1/10004.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/1/10008.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/1/13333.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/3/39991.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/4/40001.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/4/49992.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/5/53333.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/5/53335.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/5/54444.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/5/55552.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/7/71111.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/7/79999.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/8/83333.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/8/83336.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/8/88878.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/8/88889.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/8/89996.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/8/89999.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/9/99919.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/9/99991.htm#about_algebraic, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/9/99992.htm#about_algebraic, http://mklasson.com/factors/viewlog.php?sort=2&order=desc&method=algebraic&maxrows=10000, https://sites.google.com/view/algebraic-factors-of-xn-kyn, https://sites.google.com/view/factorsofk2n-1foroddk20000, https://brnikat.com/nums/cullen_woodall/algebraic.txt, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=96560&postcount=99, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=96651&postcount=101, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=21916, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=196598&postcount=492, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=203083&postcount=149, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=206065&postcount=192, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=208044&postcount=260, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=210533&postcount=336, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=452132&postcount=66, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=451337&postcount=32, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=208852&postcount=227, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=232904&postcount=604, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=383690&postcount=1, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=207886&postcount=253, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=452819&postcount=1445, https://www.numberempire.com/factoringcalculator.php, https://www.alpertron.com.ar/POLFACT.HTM, https://www.emathhelp.net/calculators/algebra-2/factoring-calculator/).

Determining the set of the minimal elements of a arbitrary set of strings under the subsequence ordering is in general unsolvable, and can be difficult even when this set is relatively simple (such as the base *b* representations of the prime numbers > *b*), also, determining the set of the minimal elements of a arbitrary set of strings under the subsequence ordering may be an open problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_problem, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/OpenQuestion.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/UnsolvedProblems.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/open.htm, https://t5k.org/notes/conjectures/) or NP-complete (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NP-CompleteProblem.html) or an undecidable problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Undecidable.html), or an example of Gödel's incompleteness theorems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoedelsFirstIncompletenessTheorem.html) (like the continuum hypothesis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContinuumHypothesis.html) and the halting problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HaltingProblem.html)), or as hard as the unsolved problems in mathematics, such as the Riemann hypothesis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/RiemannHypothesis.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RiemannHypothesis.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/open.htm#rh) and the *abc* conjecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_conjecture, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/abcConjecture.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/open.htm#abc) and the Schinzel's hypothesis *H* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schinzel%27s_hypothesis_H, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SchinzelsHypothesis.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/open.htm#h) (which are the three famous hard problems in number theory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Number_theory, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NumberTheory.html)) or their generalized conjectures including the generalized Riemann hypothesis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Riemann_hypothesis, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GeneralizedRiemannHypothesis.html) and the grand Riemann hypothesis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Riemann_hypothesis) (both of them are generalized conjectures of the Riemann hypothesis) and the *n* conjecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N_conjecture) (which is a generalized conjecture of the *abc* conjecture) and the Bateman–Horn conjecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateman%E2%80%93Horn_conjecture) (which is a generalized conjecture of the Schinzel's hypothesis *H*).

The following is a "semi-algorithm" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-algorithm) that is guaranteed to produce the minimal elements of a arbitrary set of strings under the subsequence ordering, but it is not so easy to implement:

1. *M* := *∅* 
2. while (*L* ≠ *∅*) do
3. choose *x*, a shortest string in *L*
4. *M* := *M* ∪ {*x*}
5. *L* := *L* − *sup*({*x*})

In practice, for arbitrary *L*, we cannot feasibly carry out step 5. Instead, we work with *L*', some regular overapproximation to *L*, until we can show *L*' = *∅* (which implies *L* = *∅*). In practice, *L*' is usually chosen to be a finite union of sets of the form *L*<sub>1</sub>{*L*<sub>2</sub>}*L*<sub>3</sub>, where each of *L*<sub>1</sub>, *L*<sub>2</sub>, *L*<sub>3</sub> is finite. In the case we consider in this project, we then have to determine whether such a family contains a prime > *b* or not.

To solve this problem (i.e. to compute (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) the set of the minimal elements of the base *b* representations of the prime numbers > *b* under the subsequence ordering), we need to determine whether a given family contains a prime. In practice, if family *x*{*Y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *Y* is a set of digits in base *b*) could not be ruled out as only containing composites and *Y* contains two or more digits, then a relatively small prime > *b* could always be found in this family. Intuitively, this is because there are a large number of small strings in such a family, and at least one is likely to be prime (e.g. there are 2<sup>*n*−2</sup> strings of length *n* in the family 1{3,7}9, and there are over a thousand strings of length 12 in the family 1{3,7}9, thus it is very impossible that these numbers are all composite). In the case *Y* contains only one digit, this family is of the form *x*{*y*}*z*, and there is only a single string of each length > (the length of *x* + the length of *z*), and it is not known if the following decision problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DecisionProblem.html) is recursively solvable:

**Problem: Given strings *x*, *z* (may be empty), a digit *y*, and a base *b* (*x* does not start with the digit 0, *z* ends with a digit which coprime to *b*, *y* is not 0 if *x* is empty, *y* is coprime to *b* if *z* is empty), does there exist a prime number whose base-*b* expansion is of the form *xy*<sub>*n*</sub>*z* for some *n* ≥ 0? (Note: In this problem, the base *b* may be > 36, although the bases *b* > 36 are not in this project)** (If we say "yes", then we should find a such prime (the smallest such prime may be very large, e.g. > 10<sup>25000</sup>, and if so, then we should use (probable) primality testing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Primality_test,

An algorithm to solve this problem, for example, would allow us to decide if there are any additional Fermat primes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_number, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/FermatNumber.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Fermat_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FermatNumber.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FermatPrime.html, https://pzktupel.de/Primetables/TableFermat.php, http://www.prothsearch.com/fermat.html, https://t5k.org/top20/page.php?id=8, https://t5k.org/primes/search.php?Comment=Divides&OnList=all&Number=1000000&Style=HTML, http://www.fermatsearch.org/, https://64ordle.au/fermat/, https://64ordle.au/fermat/small/, https://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=8778, https://www.primegrid.com/stats_div_llr.php, https://www.primegrid.com/primes/primes.php?project=DIV&factors=XGF&only=ALL&announcements=ALL&sortby=size&dc=yes&search=, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/PrimeGrid_Fermat_Divisor_Search, http://www.fermatsearch.org/factors/faclist.php, http://www.fermatsearch.org/factors/composite.php) (of the form 2<sup>2<sup>*n*</sup></sup>+1) other than the known ones (corresponding to *n* = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).

We call families of the form *x*{*y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *y* is a digit in base *b*) "linear" families, and we reduce these families by removing all trailing digits *y* from *x*, and removing all leading digits *y* from *z*, to make the families be easier, e.g. family 12333{3}33345 in base *b* is reduced to family 12{3}45 in base *b*, since they are in fact the same family. Our algorithm then proceeds as follows:

* 1. *M* := {minimal primes in base *b* of length 2 or 3}, *L* := union of all *x*{*Y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*) such that *x* ≠ 0 and *gcd*(*z*, *b*) = 1 and *Y* is the set of digits *y* in base *b* such that *xyz* has no subsequence in *M*.
* 2. While *L* contains nonlinear families (families which are not linear families): Explore each family of *L*, and update *L*. Examine each family of *L* by:
* 2.1. Let *w* be the shortest string in the family. If *w* has a subsequence in *M*, then remove the family from *L*. If *w* represents a prime, then add *w* to *M* and remove the family from *L*.
* 2.2. If possible, simplify the family.
* 2.3. Using the techniques below (covering congruence, algebraic factorization, or combine of them), check if the family can be proven to only contain composites (only count the numbers > *b*), and if so then remove the family from *L*.
* 3. Update *L*, after each split examine the new families as in step 2.

e.g. in decimal (base *b* = 10):

*M* := {11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 227, 251, 257, 277, 281, 349, 409, 449, 499, 521, 557, 577, 587, 727, 757, 787, 821, 827, 857, 877, 881, 887, 991}

*L* := {2{0,2}1, 2{0,8}7, 3{0,3,6,9}3, 3{0,3,6,9}9, 4{6}9, 5{0,5,8}1, 5{0,2}7, 6{0,3,6,9}3, 6{0,3,4,6,9}9, 7{0,7}7, 8{0,5}1, 8{0}7, 9{0,2,5,8}1, 9{0,3,6,9}3, 9{0,3,4,6,9}9}

and since 2221 is prime, it follows that the family 2{0,2}1 splits into the families 2{0}1 and 2{0}2{0}1

and since the family 2{0}1 can be proven to contain no primes > base (since all numbers in this family are divisible by 3), it can be removed

and since 20201 is prime, it follows that the family 2{0}2{0}1 splits into the families 2{0}21 and 22{0}1

221 and 2021 are composites, but 20021 is prime, thus add 20021 to *L*

none of 221, 2201, 22001, 220001, 2200001 are primes, but 22000001 is prime, thus add 22000001 to *L*

and since the family 3{0,3,6,9}3 can be proven to contain no primes > base (since all numbers in this family are divisible by 3), it can be removed

etc.

The process of exploring/examining/splitting a nonlinear family can be concisely expressed in a tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tree.html) of decompositions, for an example of a tree of decompositions for a nonlinear family (for the family 1{0,1,6}1 in base *b* = 9) see figure 1 of https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cbright/reports/mepn.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_17.pdf) and figure 1 of https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Papers/br10.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_18.pdf) and figure 1 of https://doi.org/10.1080/10586458.2015.1064048 (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_20.pdf). (in fact, for the main problem in this project, we should consider the family 1{0,1,6,7}1 (in base *b* = 9) instead of 1{0,1,6}1 (in base *b* = 9), but these three articles are for the original minimal prime problem (i.e. prime > *b* is not required))

Shrinking the family *x*{*Y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *Y* is a set of digits in base *b*)

* If *y* ∈ *Y* and the string *xyyz* represents a prime > *b* in base *b* (in this case, add this prime to the list) or has a subsequence which represents a prime > *b* in base *b*, then *x*{*Y*}*z* can be replaced with *x*{*Y* \ *y*}*z* ∪ *x*{*Y* \ *y*}*y*{*Y* \ *y*}*z*.
* If *y*<sub>1</sub> ∈ *Y* and *y*<sub>2</sub> ∈ *Y* and *y*<sub>1</sub> ≠ *y*<sub>2</sub> and the string *xy*<sub>1</sub>*y*<sub>2</sub>*z* represents a prime > *b* in base *b* (in this case, add this prime to the list) or has a subsequence which represents a prime > *b* in base *b*, then *x*{*Y*}*z* can be replaced with *x*{*Y* \ *y*<sub>1</sub>}{*Y* \ *y*<sub>2</sub>}*z*.
* If *y*<sub>1</sub> ∈ *Y* and *y*<sub>2</sub> ∈ *Y* and *y*<sub>1</sub> ≠ *y*<sub>2</sub> and both the strings *xy*<sub>1</sub>*y*<sub>2</sub>*z* and *xy*<sub>2</sub>*y*<sub>1</sub>*z* represent a prime > *b* in base *b* (in this case, add this prime to the list) or have a subsequence which represents a prime > *b* in base *b*, then *x*{*Y*}*z* can be replaced with *x*{*Y* \ *y*<sub>1</sub>}*z* ∪ *x*{*Y* \ *y*<sub>2</sub>}*z*.

* 2221 is a prime > 10, thus the family 2{0,2}1 splits into the two families 2{0}1 and 2{0}2{0}1.
* 227 is a prime > 10, and it is a subsequence of 5227, thus the family 5{0,2}7 splits into the two families 5{0}7 and 5{0}2{0}7.
* 449 is a prime > 10, and it is a subsequence of 6449, thus the family 6{0,3,4,6,9}9 splits into the two families 6{0,3,6,9}9 and 6{0,3,6,9}4{0,3,6,9}9.
* Both 5051 and 5501 are primes > 10, thus the family 5{0,5}1 splits into the two families 5{0}1 and 5{5}1 = {5}1.
* 8501 is a prime > 10, thus the family 8{0,5}1 splits into the family 8{0}{5}1.
* 887 is a prime > 10, and it is a subsequence of 2887, also 2087 is a prime > 10, thus the family 2{0,8}7 splits into the two families 2{0}7 and 28{0}7.
* 349 and 449 are primes > 10, and they are subsequences of 9349 and 9449, respectively, also 9049, 9649, 9949 are primes > 10, thus the family 9{0,3,4,6,9}9 splits into the two families 9{0,3,6,9}9 and 94{0,3,6,9}9.
* 251, 281, 521, 821, 881 are primes > 10, and they are subsequences of 9251, 9281, 9521, 9821, 9881, respectively, also 9001, 9221, 9551, 9851 are primes > 10, thus the family 9{0,2,5,8}1 splits into the numbers {91, 901, 921, 951, 981, 9021, 9051, 9081, 9201, 9501, 9581, 9801, 90581, 95081, 95801}.

If the methods we have discussed cannot be used to rule out or shrink *x*{*Y*}*z* where *Y* = {*y*<sub>1</sub>, *y*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *y*<sub>*n*</sub>}, then we can replace *x*{*Y*}*z* by *xy*<sub>1</sub>{*Y*}*z* ∪ *xy*<sub>2</sub>{*Y*}*z* ∪ ... ∪ *xy*<sub>*n*</sub>{*Y*}*z* and re-run the methods on this new language.

If all remain families are linear families (i.e. of the form *x*{*y*}*z*), then we search the smallest (probable) primes in these families and add these primes to the list.

e.g. in decimal (base *b* = 10):

* The smallest prime in the family 5{0}27 is 5000000000000000000000000000027.
* The smallest prime in the family {5}1 is 555555555551.
* The smallest prime in the family 8{5}1 is 8555555555555555555551, but 8555555555555555555551 is not minimal prime since 555555555551 is a subsequence of 8555555555555555555551.

There is no guarantee that the techniques discussed will ever terminate, but in practice they often do. They are able to determine the minimal primes in base *b* for 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 16 and *b* = 18, 20, 22, 24, 30. The bases *b* = 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 ≤ *b* ≤ 29, 31 ≤ *b* ≤ 36 are solved with the exception of 793+? families of the form *x*{*y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *y* is a digit in base *b*).

(for the examples of nonlinear families, see https://web.archive.org/web/20240305201337/https://stdkmd.net/nrr/prime/primecount3.htm and https://web.archive.org/web/20240305201316/https://stdkmd.net/nrr/prime/primecount3.txt (only base 10 families), nonlinear families usually have small primes if they cannot be ruled out as only containing composites by covering congruence, see the section above)

We should first make data up to linear families (i.e. only linear families left) (see https://github.com/curtisbright/mepn-data/commit/7acfa0656d3c6b759f95a031f475a30f7664a122 for the original minimal

there is nothing worse then searching a family for a long time that later is proven to contain no primes (e.g. we searched the base 16 families {C}D and {C}DD to length 10000 and searched the base 21 family B0{H}6H to length 20000 and searched the base 30 family A{0}9J to length 10000 in the past, and later we proved that the base 16 families {C}D and {C}DD both have Aurifeuillean factorization of *x*<sup>4</sup>+4×*y*<sup>4</sup> and the base 21 family B0{H}6H has a single trivial factor 4637 and the base 30 family A{0}9J has a covering set of {7, 13, 19, 31} with period 6, this is because the original program cannot remove the families which can be ruled out as only containing composites by these conditions: "Aurifeuillean factorization of *x*<sup>4</sup>+4×*y*<sup>4</sup>" and "single trivial prime factor > *b*<sup>2</sup>" and "covering congruence with period > 4", now the program can remove the families which can be ruled out as only containing composites by these conditions: "single trivial prime factor < *b*<sup>3</sup>" and "covering congruence with period ≤ 24" and "difference of *r*-th powers with *r* ≤ 5" and "Aurifeuillean factorization of *x*<sup>4</sup>+4×*y*<sup>4</sup>").

The multiplicative order (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_order, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Order.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MultiplicativeOrder.html,

We can show that: For the case of covering congruence, the numbers in the family are not equal to any element in *S*, if *n* makes the numbers > *b*, thus these factorizations are nontrivial (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triviality_(mathematics), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Trivial.html); for the case of algebraic factorization (if the numbers are factored as *F* × *G* / *d*), both *F* and *G* are > *d*, if *n* makes the numbers > *b*, thus these factorizations are nontrivial (the exceptions are the base 9 family {1} and the base 25 family {1} and the base 27 family 9{G} and the base 32 family {1}.

and it does not appear to be any covering congruence of primes, besides, since 107 is not a perfect power, thus the family CH<sub>*n*</sub>C (in base *b* = 19) has no algebraic factorization for any *n*, thus its Nash weight (or difficulty) is positive (although very low), so there must be a prime at some point (and the corresponding *n* must be == 7 mod 24).

And for *n* == 7 mod 24, we have: (all "composites without known proper factor > 1" in the list below have been trial factored (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/TrialDivision.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Trial_factoring, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TrialDivision.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/factoring.htm#trial, https://www.mersenne.ca/tf1G/, https://www.mersenne.ca/tfmissed.php, https://oeis.org/A189172) to 10<sup>9</sup>, also none of these composites have algebraic factors)

Another example of a family and its dual family are both unsolved families is the base *b* = 25 family FB{0}H (its algebraic form is 386×25<sup>*n*+1</sup>+17, and for the factorization of the numbers in the family (*n* is the number of digits in the "{}", start with the smallest *n* making the number > *b*) see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=386*25%5E%28n%2B1%29%2B17&use=n&n=0&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show) and the base *b* = 25 family H{0}FB (its algebraic form is 17×25<sup>*n*+2</sup>+386, and for the factorization of the numbers in the family (*n* is the number of digits in the "{}", start with the smallest *n* making the number > *b*) see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=17*25%5E%28n%2B2%29%2B386&use=n&n=0&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show).

Also two examples of a family and its dual family both have known (probable) primes (and these two (probable) primes are both minimal primes (assuming their primality)) but both have no easy primes (i.e. lengths ≤ 1000 in base *b*) are (the base *b* = 17 families 109{0}D and D{0}109 are dual families, and the base *b* = 21 families 1{0}5D and 5D{0}1 are also dual families):

The same holds for all other unsolved families in bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36, thus we can *almost* sure that all unsolved families in bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36 have a prime, in fact, we can *almost* sure that all unsolved families in bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36 have infinitely many primes. (if the family has algebraic factorization for some *n*, then we should only consider the *n* such that this family does not have algebraic factorization and check whether there is a covering congruence for these *n*, e.g. the unsolved family 2EB<sub>*n*</sub> is base *b* = 23, whose algebraic form is (121×23<sup>*n*</sup>−1)/2, which has a difference-of-two-squares factorization if *n* is even (factored to (11×23<sup>*n*/2</sup>−1) × (11×23<sup>*n*/2</sup>+1) / 2), thus we should only consider the odd *n* and check whether there is a covering congruence for the odd *n*)

Also, there are unsolved families in bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36 which *are impossible* to be ruled out as only containing composites (only count the numbers > *b*) (by covering congruence, algebraic factorization, or combine of them), note the difference of the unsolved families in bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36 which *are very unlikely* to be ruled out as only containing composites (only count the numbers > *b*) (by covering congruence, algebraic factorization, or combine of them), the latter *still has* a possibility, such as the three families above (family {9}D in base *b* = 21 and family 5{H}5 in base *b* = 19 and family C{H}C in base *b* = 19), the former *has no* possibility, such as the three examples below:

Family 1{7} in base *b* = 17: (its algebraic form is (23×17<sup>*n*</sup>−7)/16, and for the factorization of the numbers in the family (*n* is the number of digits in the "{}", start with the smallest *n* making the number > *b*) see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=%2823*17%5En-7%29%2F16&use=n&n=1&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)

Since 7 is not a perfect power, thus the family 17<sub>*n*</sub> (in base *b* = 17) has no algebraic factorization for any *n*, thus if this family can be ruled out as only containing composites, then it must have a covering congruence, and if the period of its covering congruence is *m*, consider the prime factor *p* dividing (23×17<sup>*n*</sup>−7)/16 for all *n* == 0 mod *m*, *p* must divide (23×17<sup>0</sup>−7)/16 = −1, which is a contradiction.

Family 9{6}M in base *b* = 25: (its algebraic form is (37×25<sup>*n*+1</sup>+63)/4, and for the factorization of the numbers in the family (*n* is the number of digits in the "{}", start with the smallest *n* making the number > *b*) see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=%2837*25%5E%28n%2B1%29%2B63%29%2F4&use=n&n=0&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)

Since 63 is not a perfect power, thus the family 96<sub>*n*</sub>M (in base *b* = 25) has no algebraic factorization for any *n*, thus if this family can be ruled out as only containing composites, then it must have a covering congruence, and if the period of its covering congruence is *m*, consider the prime factor *p* dividing (37×25<sup>*n*+1</sup>+63)/4 for all *n* == −1 mod *m*, *p* must divide (37×25<sup>(−1)+1</sup>+63)/4 = 25, and thus *p* must be 5 (since 5 is the only prime factor of 25), but no numbers in the family 9{6}M (in base *b* = 25) are divisible by 5 (since all numbers in this family are == 22 mod 25, thus are == 2 mod 5), which is a contradiction.

Family E{D} in base *b* = 25: (its algebraic form is (349×25<sup>*n*</sup>−13)/24, and for the factorization of the numbers in the family (*n* is the number of digits in the "{}", start with the smallest *n* making the number > *b*) see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=%28349*25%5En-13%29%2F24&use=n&n=1&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)

Since 13 is not a perfect power, thus the family ED<sub>*n*</sub> (in base *b* = 25) has no algebraic factorization for any *n*, thus if this family can be ruled out as only containing composites, then it must have a covering congruence, and if the period of its covering congruence is *m*, consider the prime factor *p* dividing (349×25<sup>*n*</sup>−13)/24 for all *n* == −1 mod *m*, *p* must divide the numerator of (349×25<sup>−1</sup>−13)/24 = 1/25, i.e. *p* divides 1, which is a contradiction.

Family 1{F}5 in base *b* = 27: (its algebraic form is (41×27<sup>*n*+1</sup>−275)/26, and for the factorization of the numbers in the family (*n* is the number of digits in the "{}", start with the smallest *n* making the number > *b*) see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=%2841*27%5E%28n%2B1%29-275%29%2F26&use=n&n=0&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)

Since 275 is not a perfect power, thus the family 1F<sub>*n*</sub>5 (in base *b* = 27) has no algebraic factorization for any *n*, thus if this family can be ruled out as only containing composites, then it must have a covering congruence, and if the period of its covering congruence is *m*, consider the prime factor *p* dividing (41×27<sup>*n*+1</sup>−275)/26 for all *n* == −1 mod *m*, *p* must divide (41×27<sup>(−1)+1</sup>−275)/26 = −9, and thus *p* must be 3 (since 3 is the only prime factor of −9), but no numbers in the family 1{F}5 (in base *b* = 27) are divisible by 3 (since all numbers in this family are == 5 mod 27, thus are == 2 mod 3), which is a contradiction.

In fact, the corresponding families for the largest minimal primes in bases *b* = 7, 10, 14, 22, 30 are such families, since:

Family {3}1 in base *b* = 7: (its algebraic form is (7<sup>*n*+1</sup>−5)/2, and for the factorization of the numbers in the family (*n* is the number of digits in the "{}", start with the smallest *n* making the number > *b*) see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=%287%5E%28n%2B1%29-5%29%2F2&use=n&n=1&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)

Since 5 is not a perfect power, thus the family 3<sub>*n*</sub>1 (in base *b* = 7) has no algebraic factorization for any *n*, thus if this family can be ruled out as only containing composites, then it must have a covering congruence, and if the period of its covering congruence is *m*, consider the prime factor *p* dividing (7<sup>*n*+1</sup>−5)/2 for all *n* == 0 mod *m*, *p* must divide (7<sup>0+1</sup>−5)/2 = 1, which is a contradiction.

Family 5{0}27 in base *b* = 10: (its algebraic form is 5×10<sup>*n*+2</sup>+27, and for the factorization of the numbers in the family (*n* is the number of digits in the "{}", start with the smallest *n* making the number > *b*) see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=5*10%5E%28n%2B2%29%2B27&use=n&n=0&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)

Since 27 is a cube, thus 5×10<sup>*n*+2</sup>+27 has sum-of-two-cubes factorization if 5×10<sup>*n*+2</sup> is a cube (if not, then it has no algebraic factorization), but 5×10<sup>*n*+2</sup> cannot be a perfect power, since the prime factorization of 5×10<sup>*n*+2</sup> is 2<sup>*n*+2</sup> × 5<sup>*n*+3</sup>, but *n*+2 and *n*+3 must be coprime, thus 2<sup>*n*+2</sup> × 5<sup>*n*+3</sup> cannot be a perfect power, thus the family 50<sub>*n*</sub>27 (in base *b* = 10) has no algebraic factorization for any *n*, thus if this family can be ruled out as only containing composites, then it must have a covering congruence, and if the period of its covering congruence is *m*, consider the prime factor *p* dividing 5×10<sup>*n*+2</sup>+27 for all *n* == −2 mod *m*, *p* must divide 5×10<sup>(−2)+2</sup>+27 = 32, and thus *p* must be 2 (since 2 is the only prime factor of 32), but no numbers in the family 5{0}27 (in base *b* = 10) are divisible by 2 (since all numbers in this family are == 7 mod 10, thus are == 1 mod 2), which is a contradiction.

Family 4{D} in base *b* = 14: (its algebraic form is 5×14<sup>*n*</sup>−1, and for the factorization of the numbers in the family (*n* is the number of digits in the "{}", start with the smallest *n* making the number > *b*) see http://factordb.com/index.php?query=5*14%5En-1&use=n&n=1&VP=on&VC=on&EV=on&OD=on&PR=on&FF=on&PRP=on&CF=on&U=on&C=on&perpage=200&format=1&sent=Show)

Since 1 is an *r*th power for all *r*, thus 5×14<sup>*n*</sup>−1 has difference-of-two-*r*th-powers factorization if 5×14<sup>*n*</sup> is an *r*th power (if not, then it has no algebraic factorization), but 5×14<sup>*n*</sup> cannot be a perfect power, after all, 5×14<sup>*n*</sup> is divisible by 5 but not 5<sup>2</sup>, thus the family 4D<sub>*n*</sub> (in base *b* = 14) has no algebraic factorization for any *n*, thus if this family can be ruled out as only containing composites, then it must have a covering congruence, and if the period of its covering congruence is *m*, consider the prime factor *p* dividing 5×14<sup>*n*</sup>−1 for all *n* == 0 mod *m*, *p* must divide 5×14<sup>0</sup>−1 = 4, and thus *p* must be 2 (since 2 is the only prime factor of 4), but no numbers in the family 4{D} (in base *b* = 14) are divisible by 2 (since all numbers in this family are == 13 mod 14, thus are == 1 mod 2), which is a contradiction.

Since 335 is not a perfect power, thus the family BK<sub>*n*</sub>5 (in base *b* = 22) has no algebraic factorization for any *n*, thus if this family can be ruled out as only containing composites, then it must have a covering congruence, and if the period of its covering congruence is *m*, consider the prime factor *p* dividing (251×22<sup>*n*+1</sup>−335)/21 for all *n* == −1 mod *m*, *p* must divide (251×22<sup>(−1)+1</sup>−335)/21 = −4, and thus *p* must be 2 (since 2 is the only prime factor of −4), but no numbers in the family B{K}5 (in base *b* = 22) are divisible by 2 (since all numbers in this family are == 5 mod 22, thus are == 1 mod 2), which is a contradiction.

Since 1 is an *r*th power for all *r*, thus 25×30<sup>*n*</sup>−1 has difference-of-two-*r*th-powers factorization if 25×30<sup>*n*</sup> is an *r*th power (if not, then it has no algebraic factorization), and indeed 25×30<sup>*n*</sup> is a square if *n* == 0 mod 2, but 25×30<sup>*n*</sup> cannot be a perfect power if *n* == 1 mod 2, since the prime factorization of 25×30<sup>*n*</sup> is 2<sup>*n*</sup> × 3<sup>*n*</sup> × 5<sup>*n*+2</sup>, but *n* and *n*+2 must be coprime if *n* == 1 mod 2, thus 2<sup>*n*</sup> × 3<sup>*n*</sup> × 5<sup>*n*+2</sup> cannot be a perfect power if *n* == 1 mod 2, thus the family OT<sub>*n*</sub> (in base *b* = 30) has no algebraic factorization for any *n* == 1 mod 2, thus if this family can be ruled out as only containing composites, then it must have a covering congruence on the *n* == 1 mod 2, and if the period of its covering congruence is *m*, consider the prime factor *p* dividing 25×30<sup>*n*</sup>−1 for all *n* == −1 mod 2×*m* (such *n* must be == 1 mod 2), *p* must divide the numerator of 25×30<sup>−1</sup>−1 = −1/6, i.e. *p* divides 1, which is a contradiction.

e.g. (only list the families which all numbers do not contain "prime > *b*" subsequence) (for the case of covering congruence, we can show that the corresponding numbers are > all elements in the sets if the corresponding numbers are > *b*, thus these factorizations are nontrivial; and for the case of algebraic factorization, we can show that both factors are > 1 if the corresponding numbers are > *b*, thus these factorizations are nontrivial; for the case of combine of them, we can show that for the part of covering congruence, the corresponding numbers are > all elements in the sets if the corresponding numbers are > *b*, and for the part of algebraic factorization, both factors are > 1 if the corresponding numbers are > *b*, thus these factorizations are nontrivial)

For the factor patterns of some families: (list the first 20 numbers in these families, start with the smallest number > *b* in these families) (all numbers are written in base *b*, and these factorizations are nontrivial (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triviality_(mathematics), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Trivial.html), i.e. both of these two factors are > 1, of course, one or two of these two factors may be composite)

It is interesting to note that all numbers in families {1}, 2{1}, 5{1}, 7{1}, C{1}, F{1}, M{1}, 1F{1}, 27{1}, 7C{1}, D5{1} in base *b* = 25 are generalized pentagonal numbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PentagonalNumber.html, https://www.numbersaplenty.com/set/pentagonal_number/, https://oeis.org/A001318), and all numbers in families {1}, 3{1}, 6{1}, 16{1} in base *b* = 9 and families 1{3}, A{3} in base *b* = 25 are triangular numbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TriangularNumber.html, https://www.numbersaplenty.com/set/triangular_number/, https://oeis.org/A000217), and all numbers in family {1} in base *b* = 4 and families 1{5}, 8{5}, 10{5}, A1{5} in base *b* = 16 and families 1{8}, 5{8}, L{8} in base *b* = 25 are generalized octagonal numbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octagonal_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/OctagonalNumber.html, https://www.numbersaplenty.com/set/octagonal_number/, https://oeis.org/A001082), since all generalized pentagonal numbers × 25 + 1 are also generalized pentagonal numbers, all triangular numbers × 9 + 1 and all triangular numbers × 25 + 3 are also triangular numbers, all generalized octagonal numbers × 4 + 1 and all generalized octagonal numbers × 16 + 5 and all generalized octagonal numbers × 25 + 8 are also generalized octagonal numbers (thus: In base *b* = 4, all numbers of the form (generalized octagonal numbers){1} are also generalized octagonal numbers; in base *b* = 9, all numbers of the form (triangular numbers){1} are also triangular numbers; in base *b* = 16, all numbers of the form (generalized octagonal numbers){5} are also generalized octagonal numbers; in base *b* = 25, all numbers of the form (generalized pentagonal numbers){1} are also generalized pentagonal numbers, all numbers of the form (triangular numbers){3} are also triangular numbers, all numbers of the form (generalized octagonal numbers){8} are also generalized octagonal numbers), and all generalized pentagonal numbers (except 0, 1, 2, 5, 7) and all triangular numbers (except 0, 1, 3) and all generalized octagonal numbers (except 0, 1, 5) are composite (since all generalized polygonal numbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PolygonalNumber.html, https://oeis.org/A195152, https://oeis.org/A194801, https://oeis.org/A303301) are composite, with only possible exception of indices 0, 1, −1, 2, −2), thus these families contain no primes > *b* (except the family {1} in base 4, which contains a prime 11 (5 in decimal) > *b*).

Generalized pentagonal numbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PentagonalNumber.html, https://www.numbersaplenty.com/set/pentagonal_number/, https://oeis.org/A001318) are very important in number theory, since they appear in the pentagonal number theorem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_number_theorem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PentagonalNumberTheorem.html, https://oeis.org/A010815, https://oeis.org/A195310, https://oeis.org/A175003, https://oeis.org/A238442, https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0505373.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_172.pdf), https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0411587.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_173.pdf), http://eulerarchive.maa.org//docs/originals/E542.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_174.pdf), https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0510054.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_175.pdf)) for both the partition function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_function_(number_theory), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartitionFunctionP.html, https://t5k.org/top20/page.php?id=54, https://t5k.org/primes/search.php?Comment=Partitions&OnList=all&Number=1000000&Style=HTML, https://www.numbersaplenty.com/set/partition_number/, http://www.numericana.com/answer/numbers.htm#partitions, http://www.numericana.com/data/partition.htm, http://www.numbertheory.org/php/partition.html, https://web.archive.org/web/20120719080234/http://www.btinternet.com/~se16/js/partitions.htm, https://oeis.org/A000041) and the sum-of-divisors function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_function, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/SigmaFunction.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisorFunction.html, http://www.javascripter.net/math/calculators/divisorscalculator.htm, https://oeis.org/A000203).

Also, for bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 18, the reasons for families can be ruled out as only containing composites (only count the numbers > *b*) which are needed to use to prove the "minimal prime problem" in base *b* are: (only consider the numbers coprime to *b*, i.e. only consider the number string with the first digit not 0 and the last digit coprime to *b*) (only listed the bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 18, since for 19 ≤ *b* ≤ 36 there may be reasons which are still not found by me, e.g. the family {D}GA in base *b* = 23 (which has a covering set {2,5,7,37,79}, also a covering set {3,5,7,37,79}) and the family L{5}L in base *b* = 23 (which has a covering set {2,5,7,13,37}, also a covering set {3,5,7,13,37}) are very hard to found)

Some *x*{*y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *y* is a digit in base *b*) families could not be proven to contain no primes > *b* (by covering congruence, algebraic factorization, or combine of them) but no primes > *b* could be found in the family, even after searching through numbers with over 100000 digits. In such a case, the only way to proceed is to test the primality of larger and larger numbers of such form and hope a prime is eventually discovered.

Many *x*{*y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *y* is a digit in base *b*) families contain no small primes > *b* even though they do contain very large primes. e.g.

To do this, we made use of Geoffrey Reynolds' *SRSIEVE* software (https://www.bc-team.org/app.php/dlext/?cat=3, http://web.archive.org/web/20160922072340/https://sites.google.com/site/geoffreywalterreynolds/programs/, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=631129&postcount=1, http://www.rieselprime.de/dl/CRUS_pack.zip, https://t5k.org/bios/page.php?id=905, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Srsieve, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/tree/main/srsieve_1.1.4, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/tree/main/sr1sieve_1.4.6, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/tree/main/sr2sieve_2.0.0, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/tree/main/srbsieve_1.8.2, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/tree/main/srbsieve-other-programs, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/blob/main/mtsieve_2.4.8/srsieve2.exe, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/blob/main/mtsieve_2.4.8/srsieve2cl.exe). This program uses the baby-step giant-step (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby-step_giant-step) algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Algorithm, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Algorithm.html) to find all primes *p* which divide *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c* where *p* and *n* lie in a specified range (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Interval.html), by using discrete logarithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiscreteLogarithm.html, https://www.alpertron.com.ar/DILOG.HTM, http://www.numbertheory.org/php/discrete_log.html) to solve the equation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Equation.html) *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c* == 0 mod *p* (i.e. solve the equation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Equation.html) *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c* = 0 in the finite field (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FiniteField.html) *Z*<sub>*p*</sub>) (also, this program was updated so that it also removes the *n* such that *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c* has algebraic factors (e.g. difference-of-two-squares factorization (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_two_squares) and sum/difference-of-two-cubes factorization (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_of_two_cubes) and Sophie Germain's identity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Germain%27s_identity, https://www.theoremoftheday.org/Binomial/GermainId/TotDGermainIdentity.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_478.pdf)) and difference-of-two-*n*th-powers factorization with *n* > 1 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinomialNumber.html) and sum/difference-of-two-*n*th-powers factorization with odd *n* > 1 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinomialNumber.html) and Aurifeuillean factorization (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurifeuillean_factorization, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Aurifeuillian_factor, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/AurifeuilleanFactorization.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/numbers.htm#aurifeuille, https://web.archive.org/web/20231002141924/http://colin.barker.pagesperso-orange.fr/lpa/cycl_fac.htm, http://list.seqfan.eu/oldermail/seqfan/2017-March/017363.html, http://myfactorcollection.mooo.com:8090/source/cyclo.cpp, http://myfactorcollection.mooo.com:8090/LCD_2_199, http://myfactorcollection.mooo.com:8090/LCD_2_998, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/repunit/repunitnote.htm#aurifeuillean, https://www.unshlump.com/hcn/aurif.html, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=10439, https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=515828&postcount=8, https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~brent/pd/rpb135.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_97.pdf), https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/2006-75-253/S0025-5718-05-01766-7/S0025-5718-05-01766-7.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_138.pdf), https://maths-people.anu.edu.au/~brent/pd/rpb127.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_164.pdf), https://www.jams.jp/scm/contents/Vol-2-3/2-3-16.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_167.pdf), https://web.archive.org/web/20130702000532/http://xyyxf.at.tut.by/aurifeuillean.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_443.pdf))), see https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=452132&postcount=66 and https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=451337&postcount=32 and https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=208852&postcount=227 and https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=232904&postcount=604 and https://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=21916 and https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=383690&postcount=1 and https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=207886&postcount=253 and https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=452819&postcount=1445 and https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/blob/main/srsieve_1.1.4/algebraic.c (note: for the sequence (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1), the case of "Mersenne number" in https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/blob/main/srsieve_1.1.4/algebraic.c is the case which *a* is rational power of *b*, *c* = −1 and the case which *a* is rational power of *b*, *c* = 1, *gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) ≥ 3, and the case of "GFN" in https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/blob/main/srsieve_1.1.4/algebraic.c is the case which *a* is rational power of *b*, *c* = 1, *gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) is either 1 or 2)). Since this program cannot handle the general case (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) when *gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) > 1 we only used it to sieve the sequence *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c* for primes *p* not dividing *gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1), and initialized the list of candidates to not include *n* for which there is some prime *p* dividing *gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) for which *p* dividing (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1). The program had to be modified slightly to remove a check which would prevent it from running in the case when *a*, *b*, and *c* were all odd (since then 2 divides *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*, but 2 may not divide (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1)) (see https://github.com/curtisbright/mepn-data/commit/1b55b353f46c707bbe52897573914128b3303960).

**(Edit: Now the *SRSIEVE* in *MTSIEVE* (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mtsieve/, https://www.mersenneforum.org/rogue/mtsieve.html, https://download.mersenne.ca/mtsieve, https://t5k.org/bios/page.php?id=449, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Mtsieve, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/tree/main/mtsieve_2.4.8) can handle the general case (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) when *gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) > 1, see https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/blob/main/mtsieve_2.4.8/CHANGES.txt, thus now we can sieve the sequence (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) directly)**

When sieving the sequence (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) (*a* ≥ 1, *b* ≥ 2, *c* ≠ 0, *gcd*(*a*,*c*) = 1, *gcd*(*b*,*c*) = 1), the sieve program should: (below, *r* is a linear function of *n*, *m* is a constant like *a*, *b*, *c* (*m* ≥ 2))

1. General:
* 1.1. If (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) can be written as (*m*<sup>*r*</sup>−1)/(*m*−1); display a warning message on the screen that this form is a generalized repunit number and could better be factored algebraically or sieved with another program (remove all composite *r*, and only sieve with the primes *p* == 1 mod *r*).
* 1.2. If (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) can be written as (*m*<sup>*r*</sup>+1)/(*m*+1); display a warning message on the screen that this form is a generalized Wagstaff number and could better be factored algebraically or sieved with another program (remove all composite *r*, and only sieve with the primes *p* == 1 mod 2×*r*).
* 1.3. If (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) can be written as *m*<sup>*r*</sup>+1 with even *m*; display a warning message on the screen that this form is a generalized Fermat number and could better be factored algebraically or sieved with another program (remove all non-power-of-2 *r*, and no need to sieve, just look for *r* = 2<sup>*s*</sup> (see https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=95547&postcount=63), and instead use trial division (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/TrialDivision.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Trial_factoring, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TrialDivision.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/factoring.htm#trial, https://www.mersenne.ca/tf1G/, https://www.mersenne.ca/tfmissed.php, https://oeis.org/A189172) with the primes *p* == 1 mod 2×*r*).
* 1.4. If (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) can be written as (*m*<sup>*r*</sup>+1)/2 with odd *m*; display a warning message on the screen that this form is a generalized half Fermat number and could better be factored algebraically or sieved with another program (remove all non-power-of-2 *r*, and no need to sieve, just look for *r* = 2<sup>*s*</sup> (see https://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=95547&postcount=63), and instead use trial division (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/TrialDivision.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Trial_factoring, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TrialDivision.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/factoring.htm#trial, https://www.mersenne.ca/tf1G/, https://www.mersenne.ca/tfmissed.php, https://oeis.org/A189172) with the primes *p* == 1 mod 2×*r*).
2. Remove all *n* cases:
* 2.1. If *a*, *b*, −*c* are all squares; remove all *n*.
* 2.2. If *a*, *b*, *c* are all *r*-th powers for an odd *r* > 1; remove all *n*.
* 2.3. If one of *a* and *c* is also a 4th power, and the other is of the form 4×*m*<sup>4</sup>, and *b* is also a 4th power; remove all *n*. These are Aurifeuillean factors.
3. Remove partial *n* cases:
* 3.1. If *a* and −*c* are both squares; remove all *n* == 0 mod 2.
* 3.2. If *a* and *c* are both *r*-th powers for an odd *r* > 1; for each such *r*, remove all *n* == 0 mod *r*.
* 3.3. If one of *a* and *c* is also a 4th power, and the other is of the form 4×*m*<sup>4</sup>; remove all *n* == 0 mod 4.
* 3.4. If one of *a* and *c* is also a 4th power, and the other is of the form 4×*m*<sup>4</sup>, and *b* is a square; remove all *n* == 0 mod 2.
* 3.5. If *a*, *c*, 4×*b* are all 4th powers; remove all *n* == 1 mod 2.
* 3.6. If *a* and *c* are both 4th powers, and 2×*b* is a square; remove all *n* == 2 mod 4.

#1 and #2 should all be checked first before preceding, #3.3 and #3.4 and #3.5 are more Aurifeuillean factors.

Coordination with existing code:

* If all *n* are removed by algebraic factors for sequence (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1), program should stop immediately. This means that this family can be proven to only contain composites.
* If some *n* are removed by algebraic factors for sequence (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1), program continues sieving for removing the numbers with small prime factors.
* Program should be able to handle input of one or multiple sequences (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) at the screen or in a file. Some sequences (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) could have algebraic factors while others do not.
* Program should be able to handle an already sieved file as input, check the file for algebraic factors, remove them, and then continue sieving more deeply. Once again some sequences (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) could have algebraic factors while others do not.

Once the numbers with small divisors had been removed, it remained to test the remaining numbers using a probable primality test. For this we used the software *LLR* by Jean Penné (http://jpenne.free.fr/index2.html, https://t5k.org/bios/page.php?id=431, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/LLR, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/tree/main/llr403win64, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/tree/main/llr403linux64) or *PFGW* (https://sourceforge.net/projects/openpfgw/, https://t5k.org/bios/page.php?id=175, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/PFGW, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/tree/main/pfgw_win_4.0.3). Although undocumented, it is possible to run these two programs on numbers of the form (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*d* when *d* > 1 (however, of course, the numbers (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*d* with |*c*| ≠ 1 or/and *d* ≠ 1 or/and *a* > *b*<sup>*n*</sup> can only be probable primes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_prime, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/PRP.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Probable_prime, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ProbablePrime.html, http://www.primenumbers.net/prptop/prptop.php, https://web.archive.org/web/20240202224722/https://stdkmd.net/nrr/records.htm#probableprimenumbers, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/repunit/prpfactors.htm, https://www.mersenne.ca/prp.php?show=1, https://www.alfredreichlg.de/10w7/prp.html, http://factordb.com/listtype.php?t=1) tested; the numbers *a*×2<sup>*n*</sup>±1 (with *a* < 2<sup>*n*</sup>) are the fastest to test, *a*×2<sup>*n*</sup>+1 numbers are tested using the Proth algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proth%27s_theorem, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Proth%27s_theorem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ProthsTheorem.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#proth), *a*×2<sup>*n*</sup>−1 numbers are tested using the Lucas-Lehmer-Riesel algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas%E2%80%93Lehmer%E2%80%93Riesel_test); the numbers *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>±1 (with *b* > 2, *a* < *b*<sup>*n*</sup>) can also be definitely prime (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provable_prime, https://web.archive.org/web/20240202224722/https://stdkmd.net/nrr/records.htm#primenumbers, http://factordb.com/listtype.php?t=4) tested, *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1 numbers are tested using the *N*−1 Pocklington algorithm (https://t5k.org/prove/prove3_1.html, http://bln.curtisbright.com/2013/10/09/the-n-1-and-n1-primality-tests/, http://irvinemclean.com/maths/pfaq4.htm, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocklington_primality_test, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Pocklington%27s_theorem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PocklingtonsTheorem.html, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/pock/, http://factordb.com/nmoverview.php?method=1), *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1 numbers are tested using the *N*+1 Morrison algorithm (https://t5k.org/prove/prove3_2.html, http://bln.curtisbright.com/2013/10/09/the-n-1-and-n1-primality-tests/, http://irvinemclean.com/maths/pfaq4.htm, http://factordb.com/nmoverview.php?method=2)), so this program required no modifications. A script was also written which allowed one to run srsieve while *LLR* or *PFGW* was testing the remaining candidates, so that when a divisor was found by srsieve on a number which had not yet been tested by *LLR* or *PFGW* it would be removed from the list of candidates.

Some of the left families may cover another left family, e.g. the base 19 left family 5{H}5 covers another base 19 left family 5{H}05, and if the smallest prime in family 5{H}5 in base 19 has length *n*, and the family 5{H}05 in base 19 has no prime with length ≤ *n*, then family 5{H}05 in base 19 can be removed from the unsolved families for base 19, however, if the smallest prime in family 5{H}5 in base 19 has length *n*, but the family 5{H}05 in base 19 is not tested to length *n* or more, then family 5{H}05 in base 19 should not be removed from the unsolved families for base 19, since a number in family 5{H}05 covers the prime in family 5{H}5 with length *n* if and only if the length of this number is ≥ *n*+1; besides, the base 19 left family FH0{H} covers another base 19 left family FHHH0{H}, and if the smallest prime in family FH0{H} in base 19 has length *n*, and the family FHHH0{H} in base 19 has no prime with length ≤ *n*+1, then family FHHH0{H} in base 19 can be removed from the unsolved families for base 19, however, if the smallest prime in family FH0{H} in base 19 has length *n*, but the family FHHH0{H} in base 19 is not tested to length *n*+1 or more, then family FHHH0{H} in base 19 should not be removed from the unsolved families for base 19, since a number in family FHHH0{H} covers the prime in family FH0{H} with length *n* if and only if the length of this number is ≥ *n*+2; besides, the base 21 left family {9}D covers another base 21 left family F{9}D, and if the smallest prime in family {9}D in base 21 has length *n*, and the family F{9}D in base 21 has no prime with length ≤ *n*, then family F{9}D in base 21 can be removed from the unsolved families for base 21, however, if the smallest prime in family {9}D in base 21 has length *n*, but the family F{9}D in base 21 is not tested to length *n* or more, then family F{9}D in base 21 should not be removed from the unsolved families for base 21, since a number in family F{9}D covers the prime in family {9}D with length *n* if and only if the length of this number is ≥ *n*+1 (if a family has no primes, then we say "the smallest prime in this family has length ∞ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Infinite.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Infinity.html) (instead of 0 or −1)", see http://gladhoboexpress.blogspot.com/2019/05/prime-sandwiches-made-with-one-derbread.html and http://chesswanks.com/seq/a306861.txt (for the *OEIS* sequence https://oeis.org/A306861) and http://chesswanks.com/seq/a269254.txt (for the *OEIS* sequence https://oeis.org/A269254) (since this is more convenient, e.g. the *n* of the smallest prime in the base 21 family 9<sub>*n*</sub>D, this family has been searched to *n* = 100000 with no prime or probable prime found, we can use ">100000" for the *n* of the smallest prime in the base 21 family 9<sub>*n*</sub>D (while for the *n* of the smallest prime in the base 13 family A3<sub>*n*</sub>A, it is 592199), ">100000" includes infinity (since infinity is > 100000) but does not includes 0 or −1, it is still possible that there is no prime in the base 21 family 9<sub>*n*</sub>D, although by the heuristic argument (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_argument, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Heuristic.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Heuristic.html, https://web.archive.org/web/20230911032453/https://www.utm.edu/staff/caldwell/preprints/Heuristics.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_112.pdf), https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04483.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_113.pdf)) above, this is very impossible, also "the smallest *n* ≥ 1 such that (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) is prime" should be the infimum (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Infimum.html) of the set *S* of the numbers *n* ≥ 1 such that (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) is prime, and if there is no *n* ≥ 1 such that (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) is prime, then this set *S* is the empty set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EmptySet.html), and by the definition of "inf", the infimum of the empty set is ∞), ∞ is > any finite number, e.g. "the smallest *n* ≥ 1 such that *k*×2<sup>*n*</sup>+1 is prime" is ∞ for *k* = 78557, 157114, 271129, 271577, 314228, 322523, 327739, 482719, ..., while it is 31172165 for *k* = 10223 and 13018586 for *k* = 19249, another example is "the smallest *n* such that (*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1)/(*b*−1) is prime" is ∞ for *b* = 9, 25, 32, 49, 64, 81, 121, 125, 144, 169, 216, 225, 243, 289, 324, 343, 361, 441, 484, 529, 625, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961, 1000, ..., while it is 62903 for *b* = 691 and 41189 for *b* = 693).

The final goal of this project is finding all minimal primes and proving that these are all such primes (including the primality proving for the probable primes) in all bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36, i.e. solving all families in all bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36. Solving all (left) families in all bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36 (and proving the primality of all probable primes in the sets of all bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36) is not possible but we aim to solve many of them (and proving the primality of many of them), at least find a *probable* prime for many of them (since the smallest prime in a family may be too large (> 10<sup>25000</sup>) to be proved primality, unless its *N*−1 or/and *N*+1 can be ≥ 25% factored).

These sets of minimal primes are computed (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) by: make data up to linear families (i.e. only linear families left)

For every solved base *b*, we give the number of minimal primes (or probable prime, which is a minimal prime assuming its primality) and the top 10 minimal primes (or probable prime, which is a minimal prime assuming its primality) in the table below, and the minimal primes (or probable prime, which is a minimal prime assuming its primality) are exactly the elements in the "kernel *b*" file. For every unsolved base *b*, we give the current greatest lower bound (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_lower_bound, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GreatestLowerBound.html) and the current least upper bound (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_upper_bound, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LeastUpperBound.html) for the number of minimal primes (or probable prime, which is a minimal prime assuming its primality) and the top 10 known minimal primes (or probable prime, which is a minimal prime assuming its primality) and the number of families of the form *x*{*y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *y* is a digit in base *b*) which have no known prime (or strong probable prime) members > *b*, nor can be ruled out as only containing composites (only count the numbers > *b*) (by covering congruence, algebraic factorization, or combine of them) in the table below, and the greatest lower bound (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_lower_bound, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GreatestLowerBound.html) for the number of minimal primes (or probable prime, which is a minimal prime assuming its primality) is exactly the number of the elements in the "kernel *b*" file (also, the currently known minimal primes (or probable prime, which is a minimal prime assuming its primality) are exactly the elements in the "kernel *b*" file), and the left families (i.e. families which have no known prime (or strong probable prime) members > *b*, nor can be ruled out as only containing composites (only count the numbers > *b*) (by covering congruence, algebraic factorization, or combine of them)) (all of them are linear families, i.e. of the form *x*{*y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *y* is a digit in base

by another left family (e.g. the base 19 left family 5{H}05 is covered by another base 19 left family 5{H}5, thus the base 19 left family 5{H}05 *may* contain no minimal primes) if we assume the

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_upper_bound, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LeastUpperBound.html) for the number of minimal primes (or probable prime, which is a minimal prime assuming its

"kernel *b*" file) and the number of left families (i.e. the number of families in the "left *b*" file), also, we give the searching limit of length for the linear families, if there are any more minimal primes (or probable prime, which is a minimal prime assuming its primality) base *b* they must have > this many digits in base *b*.

Four coincidences (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_coincidence, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Coincidence.html):

* The length of the largest minimal prime in bases *b* = 18 and *b* = 20 are both 6271 (in theory, *b* = 20 should be about 1.65 times as *b* = 18).
* The length of the 10401st minimal prime in base *b* = 17 is exactly 10401.
* Bases *b* = 20 and *b* = 23 have two same type of families which have the minimal prime with the same length: (*b*−1)×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1 (both have length 15: J00000000000001 and M00000000000001, respectively) and *b*<sup>*n*</sup>−(*b*−1) (both have length 17: JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ1 and MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM1, respectively).

These "unsolved" families in fact have larger (probable) primes (found by other projects), but since the length of these (probable) primes are larger than the search limit of the corresponding bases *b*, and they are not in the kernel files (nor counted in the condensed table above) since they *may* not be the next minimal primes in base *b*, and the indices of these minimal primes in base *b* are unknown: (since the family {L}G in base *b* = 27 covers two other unsolved families {L}0G and N9{L}G in base *b* = 27, thus the family {L}0G only needs to search to length 101106 and the family N9{L}G only needs to search to length 101107)

* File "left *b*": *x*{*y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *y* is a digit in base *b*) families in base *b* such that we were unable to determine if they contain a prime > *b* or not (i.e. *x*{*y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *y* is a digit in base *b*) families in base *b* such that no prime member > *b* could be found, nor could the family be ruled out as only containing composites (only count the numbers > *b*)), we reduce these families by removing all trailing digits *y* from *x*, and removing all leading digits *y* from *z*, to make the families be easier, e.g. family 12333{3}33345 in base *b* is reduced to family 12{3}45 in base *b*, since they are in fact the same family, these families are sorted by "the length *n* number in these families, from the smallest number to the largest number, this *n* is large enough such that *n* replaced to any larger number does not affect the sorting" (e.g. for base 17, we sort with B{0}B3 -> B{0}DB -> {B}2BE -> {B}2E -> {B}E9 -> {B}EE, since in this case 7 digits is enough, B0000B3 < B0000DB < BBBB2BE < BBBBB2E < BBBBBE9 < BBBBBEE, if the 7 replaced to any larger number, this result of the sorting will not change **(edit: the base 17 family {B}2E was already solved (the probable prime found is B<sub>67103</sub>2E), and the base 17 family {B}2BE is now unneeded since this family is covered by the family {B}2E, but I just use some examples to show how I sort the families in the "left *b*" files)**) (just like https://stdkmd.net/nrr/1/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/2/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/3/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/4/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/5/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/6/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/7/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/8/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/9/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/cont/#form, but not completely like https://stdkmd.net/nrr/cert/1/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/cert/2/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/cert/3/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/cert/4/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/cert/5/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/cert/6/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/cert/7/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/cert/8/ and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/cert/9/, e.g. "1w77" ({1}77 in the notation for this project) should be between "11173" ({1}73 in the notation for this project) and "11179" ({1}79 in the notation for this project), "337w" (33{7} in the notation for this project) should be between "337w3" (33{7}3 in the notation for this project) and "337w9" (33{7}9 in the notation for this project), etc.) (note that some of the left families may cover another left family, e.g. the base 19 left family 5{H}5 covers another base 19 left family 5{H}05, and if the smallest prime in family 5{H}5 in base 19 has length *n*, and the family 5{H}05 in base 19 has no prime with length ≤ *n*, then family 5{H}05 in base 19 can be removed from the unsolved families for base 19, however, if the smallest prime in family 5{H}5 in base 19 has length *n*, but the family 5{H}05 in base 19 is not tested to length *n* or more, then family 5{H}05 in base 19 should not be removed from the unsolved families for base 19, since a number in family 5{H}05 covers the prime in family 5{H}5 with length *n* if and only if the length of this number is ≥ *n*+1; besides, the base 19 left family FH0{H} covers another base 19 left family FHHH0{H}, and if the smallest prime in family FH0{H} in base 19 has length *n*, and the family FHHH0{H} in base 19 has no prime with length ≤ *n*+1, then family FHHH0{H} in base 19 can be removed from the unsolved families for base 19, however, if the smallest prime in family FH0{H} in base 19 has length *n*, but the family FHHH0{H} in base 19 is not tested to length *n*+1 or more, then family FHHH0{H} in base 19 should not be removed from the unsolved families for base 19, since a number in family FHHH0{H} covers the prime in family FH0{H} with length *n* if and only if the length of this number is ≥ *n*+2; besides, the base 21 left family {9}D covers another base 21 left family F{9}D, and if the smallest prime in family {9}D in base 21 has length *n*, and the family F{9}D in base 21 has no prime with length ≤ *n*, then family F{9}D in base 21 can be removed from the unsolved families for base 21, however, if the smallest prime in family {9}D in base 21 has length *n*, but the family F{9}D in base 21 is not tested to length *n* or more, then family F{9}D in base 21 should not be removed from the unsolved families for base 21, since a number in family F{9}D covers the prime in family {9}D with length *n* if and only if the length of this number is ≥ *n*+1 (if a family has no primes, then we say "the smallest prime in this family has length ∞ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Infinite.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Infinity.html) (instead of 0 or −1)", see http://gladhoboexpress.blogspot.com/2019/05/prime-sandwiches-made-with-one-derbread.html and http://chesswanks.com/seq/a306861.txt (for the *OEIS* sequence https://oeis.org/A306861) and http://chesswanks.com/seq/a269254.txt (for the *OEIS* sequence https://oeis.org/A269254) (since this is more convenient, e.g. the *n* of the smallest prime in the base 21 family 9<sub>*n*</sub>D, this family has been searched to *n* = 100000 with no prime or probable prime found, we can use ">100000" for the *n* of the smallest prime in the base 21 family 9<sub>*n*</sub>D (while for the *n* of the smallest prime in the base 13 family A3<sub>*n*</sub>A, it is 592199), ">100000" includes infinity (since infinity is > 100000) but does not includes 0 or −1, it is still possible that there is no prime in the base 21 family 9<sub>*n*</sub>D, although by the heuristic argument (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_argument, https://t5k.org/glossary/xpage/Heuristic.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Heuristic.html, https://web.archive.org/web/20230911032453/https://www.utm.edu/staff/caldwell/preprints/Heuristics.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_112.pdf), https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04483.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_113.pdf)) above, this is very impossible, also "the smallest *n* ≥ 1 such that (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) is prime" should be the infimum (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Infimum.html) of the set *S* of the numbers *n* ≥ 1 such that (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) is prime, and if there is no *n* ≥ 1 such that (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) is prime, then this set *S* is the empty set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EmptySet.html), and by the definition of "inf", the infimum of the empty set is ∞), ∞ is > any finite number, e.g. "the smallest *n* ≥ 1 such that *k*×2<sup>*n*</sup>+1 is prime" is ∞ for *k* = 78557, 157114, 271129, 271577, 314228, 322523, 327739, 482719, ..., while it is 31172165 for *k* = 10223 and 13018586 for *k* = 19249, another example is "the smallest *n* such that (*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1)/(*b*−1) is prime" is ∞ for *b* = 9, 25, 32, 49, 64, 81, 121, 125, 144, 169, 216, 225, 243, 289, 324, 343, 361, 441, 484, 529, 625, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961, 1000, ..., while it is 62903 for *b* = 691 and 41189 for *b* = 693))
