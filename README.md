A Prime Game:

Write down a multidigit prime number (i.e. a prime number > 10), and I can always strike out 0 or more digits to get a prime in this list:

{11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 227, 251, 257, 277, 281, 349, 409, 449, 499, 521, 557, 577, 587, 727, 757, 787, 821, 827, 857, 877, 881, 887, 991, 2087, 2221, 5051, 5081, 5501, 5581, 5801, 5851, 6469, 6949, 8501, 9001, 9049, 9221, 9551, 9649, 9851, 9949, 20021, 20201, 50207, 60649, 80051, 666649, 946669, 5200007, 22000001, 60000049, 66000049, 66600049, 80555551, 555555555551, 5000000000000000000000000000027}

e.g.

* Write down the prime 149 → I can delete the digit 4, to get the prime 19
* Write down the prime 439 → I can delete the digit 9, to get the prime 43
* Write down the prime 857 → I can delete zero digits, to get the prime 857
* Write down the prime 2081 → I can delete the digit 0, to get the prime 281
* Write down the largest known double Mersenne prime 170141183460469231731687303715884105727 (2<sup>127</sup>−1) → I can delete all digits except the third-leftmost 1 and the second-rightmost 3, to get the prime 13
* Write down the largest known Fermat prime 65537 → I can delete the 6 and the 3, to get the prime 557 (also I can choose to delete the 6 and two 5's, to get the prime 37) (also I can choose to delete two 5's and the 3, to get the prime 67) (also I can choose to delete the 6, one 5, and the 7, to get the prime 53)
* Write down the famous repunit prime 1111111111111111111 (with 19 1's) → I can delete 17 1's, to get the prime 11
* Write down the prime 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007 (which is the next prime after 10<sup>60</sup>) → I can delete all 0's, to get the prime 17
* Write down the prime 95801 → I can delete the 9, to get the prime 5801
* Write down the prime 946969 → I can delete the first 9 and two 6's, to get the prime 499
* Write down the prime 90000000581 → I can delete five 0's, the 5, and the 8, to get the prime 9001
* Write down the prime 8555555555555555555551 → I can delete the 8 and nine 5's, to get the prime 555555555551

Now we extend this prime game to bases other than 10.

The minimal elements (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_element) (https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MaximalElement.html for maximal element, the dual of minimal element, unfortunely there is no article "minimal element" in mathworld, a minimal element of a set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Set.html) under a partial ordering binary relation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinaryRelation.html) is a maximal element of the same set under its converse relation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_relation), a converse relation of a partial ordering relation must also be a partial ordering relation) of the prime numbers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/Prime.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Prime, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumber.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#definition, https://oeis.org/A000040) which are > *b* written in the positional numeral system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_numeral_system) with radix (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/Radix.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Base, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Radix.html) *b*, as digit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_digit, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Digit, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Digit.html) strings (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/String.html) under the subsequence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsequence, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Subsequence.html) ordering (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartialOrder.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartiallyOrderedSet.html), for 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36 (I stop at base 36 since this base is a maximum base for which it is possible to write the numbers with the symbols 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 and A, B, C, ..., Z, references: http://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/converter.html, https://www.dcode.fr/base-36-cipher, http://www.urticator.net/essay/5/567.html, http://www.urticator.net/essay/6/624.html, https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int, https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/BaseForm.html, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base36, https://web.archive.org/web/20150320103231/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_36, https://baseconvert.com/, https://www.calculand.com/unit-converter/zahlen.php?og=Base+2-36&ug=1, also see https://primes.utm.edu/notes/words.html for the English words which are prime numbers when viewed as a number base 36), using A−Z to represent digit values 10 to 35.

"The set of strings ordered by subsequence" is a partially ordered set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartialOrder.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PartiallyOrderedSet.html), since this binary relation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_relation, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinaryRelation.html) is reflexive (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Reflexive.html), antisymmetric (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisymmetric_relation), and transitive (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation), and thus we can draw its Hasse diagram (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagram, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HasseDiagram.html) and find its greatest element (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_element), least element (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_element), maximal elements (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_element, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MaximalElement.html), and minimal elements (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_element), however, the greatest element and least element may not exist, and for an infinite set (such as the set of the "prime numbers > *b*" strings in base *b* (for a given base *b* ≥ 2), for the proofs for that there are infinitely many primes, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_theorem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclidsTheorems.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#euclid, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/euclids.html, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/topproof.html, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/goldbach.html, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/kummers.html, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/Saidak.html)), the maximal elements also may not exist, thus we are only interested on finding the minimal elements of these sets, and we define "minimal set" of a set as the set of the minimal elements of this set, under a given partially ordered binary relation (this binary relation is "is a subsequence of" in this article))

By the theorem that there are no infinite (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_set, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/Infinite.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/InfiniteSet.html) antichains (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichain, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Antichain.html) (i.e. a subset of a partially ordered set such that any two distinct elements in the subset are incomparable (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparability, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComparableElements.html)) for the subsequence ordering (i.e. the set of the minimal elements of any set under the subsequence ordering must be finite, even if this set is infinite, such as the set of the "prime numbers > *b*" strings in base *b* (for a given base *b* ≥ 2), for the proofs for that there are infinitely many primes, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_theorem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclidsTheorems.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#euclid, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/euclids.html, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/topproof.html, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/goldbach.html, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/kummers.html, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/infinite/Saidak.html), there must be only finitely such minimal elements in every base *b*.

Addition (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Addition, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Addition.html) and multiplication (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Multiplication, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Multiplication.html) are the basic operations of arithmetic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Arithmetic, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Arithmetic.html) (which is also the basics of mathematics (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Mathematics, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Mathematics.html)). In the addition operation, the identity element (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_element, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/IdentityElement.html) is 0, and all natural numbers > 0 can be written as the sum of many 1’s, and the number 1 cannot be broken up; in the multiplication operation, the identity element is 1, and all natural numbers > 1 can be written as the product of many prime numbers, and the prime numbers cannot be broken up. Also, prime numbers are central in number theory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Number_theory, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NumberTheory.html) because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/FundamentalTheorem.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FundamentalTheoremofArithmetic.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#fta): every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Factorization, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeFactorization.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeFactorizationAlgorithms.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/factoring.htm) as a product of primes that is unique up to (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_to) their order. Also, primes are the natural numbers *n* > 1 such that if *n* divides (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divides, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/Divides.html, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/Divisor.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Factor, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Divides.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Divisor.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Divisible.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#divisor) *x*×*y* (*x* and *y* are natural numbers), then *n* divides either *x* or *y* (or both). Also, prime numbers are the numbers *n* such that the ring (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Ring.html) of integers modulo *n* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integers_modulo_n, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Mod.html) (i.e. the ring *Z*<sub>*n*</sub>) is a field (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Field.html) (also is an integral domain (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_domain, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/IntegralDomain.html), also is a division ring (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_ring), also has no zero divisors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_divisor, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ZeroDivisor.html) other than 0 (for the special case that *n* = 1, it is the zero ring (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_ring, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TrivialRing.html))). Also, see https://primes.utm.edu/ (The Prime Pages, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrimePages, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/The_Prime_Pages) and https://www.primegrid.com/ (Primegrid, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrimeGrid, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/PrimeGrid) and http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm (the set of the primes) and http://www.numericana.com/answer/factoring.htm (factoring into primes). Besides, "the set of the minimal elements of the base *b* representations of the prime numbers > *b* under the subsequence ordering" to "the set of the prime numbers (except *b* itself) digit strings with length > 1 in base *b*" to "the partially ordered binary relation by subsequence" is "the set of the prime numbers" to "the set of the integers > 1" to "the partially ordered binary relation by divisibility" (and indeed, the "> 1" in "the prime numbers (except *b* itself) digit strings with length > 1 in base *b*" can be corresponded to the "> 1" in "the integers > 1") (for the reason why *b* itself is excluded (when *b* is prime, if *b* is composite, then there is no difference to include the *b* itself or not), see the sections below and https://mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=531632&postcount=7, the main reason is that *b* is the *only* prime ending with 0), thus the problem in this article is very important and beautiful.

(we do not research substring in this article, because for substring ordering, "the set of the minimal elements of the base 10 representations of the prime numbers > 10" are very likely to be infinite (and thus almost unsolvable), since all primes of the form 1{0}3 (i.e. https://oeis.org/A159352, for the exponents see https://oeis.org/A049054, also see https://stdkmd.net/nrr/1/10003.htm) or 3{0}1 (i.e. https://oeis.org/A259866, for the exponents see https://oeis.org/A056807, also see https://stdkmd.net/nrr/3/30001.htm) are minimal elements of the base 10 representations of the prime numbers > 10 under the substring ordering, and there is likely infinitely many primes of the form 1{0}3 and infinitely many primes of the form 3{0}1, see https://web.archive.org/web/20100628035147/http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/98/exp_primes and https://mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=564786&postcount=3 and https://mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=461665&postcount=7)

However, including the base (*b*) itself results in automatic elimination of all possible extension numbers with "0 after 1" from the set (when the base is prime, if the base is composite, then there is no difference to include the base (*b*) itself or not), which is quite restrictive (since when the base is prime, then the base (*b*) itself is the only prime ending with 0, i.e. having trailing zero (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailing_zero), since in any base, all numbers ending with 0 (i.e. having trailing zero) are divisible by the base (*b*), thus cannot be prime unless it is equal the base (*b*), i.e. "10" in base *b*, note that the numbers cannot have leading zero (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_zero), since typically this is not the way we write numbers (in any base), thus for all primes in our sets (i.e. all primes > base (*b*)), all zero digits must be "between" other digits). (for the reference of this, see https://mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=531632&postcount=7)

Besides, this problem is better than the original minimal prime problem since this problem is regardless whether 1 is considered as prime or not, i.e. no matter 1 is considered as prime or not prime (https://primes.utm.edu/notes/faq/one.html, https://primefan.tripod.com/Prime1ProCon.html, https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL15/Caldwell2/cald6.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_24.pdf), http://www.numericana.com/answer/numbers.htm#one), the sets in this problem are the same, while the sets in the original minimal prime problem are different, e.g. in base 10, if 1 is considered as prime, then the set in the original minimal prime problem is {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 89, 409, 449, 499, 6469, 6949, 9049, 9649, 9949, 60649, 666649, 946669, 60000049, 66000049, 66600049}, while if 1 is not considered as prime, then the set in the original minimal prime problem is {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 19, 41, 61, 89, 409, 449, 499, 881, 991, 6469, 6949, 9001, 9049, 9649, 9949, 60649, 666649, 946669, 60000049, 66000049, 66600049}, however, in base 10, the set in this problem is always {11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 227, 251, 257, 277, 281, 349, 409, 449, 499, 521, 557, 577, 587, 727, 757, 787, 821, 827, 857, 877, 881, 887, 991, 2087, 2221, 5051, 5081, 5501, 5581, 5801, 5851, 6469, 6949, 8501, 9001, 9049, 9221, 9551, 9649, 9851, 9949, 20021, 20201, 50207, 60649, 80051, 666649, 946669, 5200007, 22000001, 60000049, 66000049, 66600049, 80555551, 555555555551, 5000000000000000000000000000027}, no matter 1 is considered as prime or not prime.

The third reason for excluding the single-digit primes is that they are trivial like that Conjectures ‘R Us Sierpinski/Riesel conjectures base *b* requires exponent *n* ≥ 1 for these primes (see https://mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=447679&postcount=27), *n* = 0 is not acceptable to avoid the trivial primes (e.g. 2×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1, 4×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1, 6×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1, 10×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1, 12×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1, 16×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1, 3×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1, 4×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1, 6×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1, 8×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1, 12×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1, 14×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1, ... cannot be quickly eliminated with *n* = 0, or the conjectures become much more easy and uninteresting), for the same reason, this minimal prime puzzle requires ≥ *b* (i.e. ≥ 2 digits) for these primes, single-digit primes are not acceptable to avoid the trivial primes (e.g. families containing digit 2, 3, 5, 7, B, D, H, J, N, T, V, ... cannot be quickly eliminated with the single-digit prime, or the conjectures become much more easy and uninteresting).

The fourth reason for excluding the primes ≤ *b* is that starting with *b*+1 makes the formula of the number of possible (first digit,last digit) combo of a minimal prime in base *b* more simple and smooth number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SmoothNumber.html), it is (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*) (https://oeis.org/A062955), where *eulerphi* is Euler's totient function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/EulersPhi.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TotientFunction.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/modular.htm#phi, https://oeis.org/A000010), since *b*−1 is the number of possible first digit (except 0, all digits can be first digit), and *eulerphi*(*b*) is the number of possible last digit (only digits coprime to *b* can be last digit), by rule of product, there are (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*) possible (first digit,last digit) combo, and if start with *b*, then when *b* is prime, there is an additional possible (first digit,last digit) combo: (1,0), and hence the formula will be (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)+1 if *b* is prime, or (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*) if *b* is composite (the fully formula will be (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)+*isprime*(*b*) or (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)+*floor*((*b*−*eulerphi*(*b*)) / (*b*−1))), which is more complex, and if start with 1 (i.e. the original minimal prime problem), the formula is much more complex.

It is found that both "number of minimal primes base *b*" and "length of the largest minimal prime base *b*" are roughly (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/AsymptoticallyEqual.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Asymptotic.html) *e*<sup>*γ*×(*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)</sup>, where *e* = 2.718281828459... is the base of the natural logarithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/e.html, https://oeis.org/A001113), *γ* = 0.577215664901 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_constant, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/Gamma.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Euler-MascheroniConstant.html, https://oeis.org/A001620), *eulerphi* is Euler's totient function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/EulersPhi.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TotientFunction.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/modular.htm#phi, https://oeis.org/A000010), you can see the condensed table for bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36 in the bottom of this article, *e*<sup>*γ*×(*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)</sup> is an exponential sequence (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExponentialGrowth.html) for (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*) (https://oeis.org/A062955), and since (*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*) has polynomial growth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Polynomial.html) for *b* (since it is always between *b*−1 and *b*<sup>2</sup>), thus *e*<sup>*γ*×(*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)</sup> has exponential growth for *b*, and "largest minimal prime base *b*" is roughly *b*<sup>*e*<sup>*γ*×(*b*−1)×*eulerphi*(*b*)</sup></sup>, which has double exponential growth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_exponential_function) for *b*. (there are also asymptotic analysis for other sets of primes in various bases *b*, such as the left-truncatable primes and the right-truncatable primes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncatable_prime, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/LeftTruncatablePrime.html, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/RightTruncatablePrime.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TruncatablePrime.html, https://www.numbersaplenty.com/set/truncatable_prime/) in various bases *b*, see http://chesswanks.com/num/LTPs/ for the left-truncatable primes in bases *b* ≤ 120 and http://fatphil.org/maths/rtp/rtp.html for the right-truncatable primes in bases *b* ≤ 90)

This problem covers finding the smallest prime of these forms in the same base *b* (or proving that such prime does not exist): (while the original minimal prime problem does not cover some of these forms for some bases (or all bases) *b*)

In fact, this problem covers finding the smallest prime of these form in the same base *b*: (where *x*, *y*, *z* are any digits in base *b*)

* *x*{0}*y*
* *x*{*y*} (unless *y* = 1) (see https://stdkmd.net/nrr/abbbb.htm)

* {*x*}*yx* (unless either *x* = 1 or there is a prime of the form {*x*}*y* (or both)) (see https://stdkmd.net/nrr/aaaba.htm)

The primes in forms *x*{*y*}, {*x*}*y*, *xy*{*x*}, {*x*}*yx* in base *b* are near-repdigit primes (https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/NearRepdigitPrime.html, https://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=15, https://oeis.org/A164937, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/#factortables_nr, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/records.htm#nrprime, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/records.htm#nrprp) in base *b*.

Proving that "the set of the minimal elements of the base *b* representations of the prime numbers > *b* under the subsequence ordering" = the set *S* is equivalent to (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_equivalence):

* Prove that all elements in *S*, when read as base *b* representation, are primes > *b*.
* Prove that all proper subsequence of all elements in *S*, when read as base *b* representation, which are > *b*, are composite (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_number, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/Composite.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Composite_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CompositeNumber.html, https://oeis.org/A002808).
* Prove that all primes > *b*, when written in base *b*, contain at least one element in *S* as subsequence (equivalently, prove that all strings not containing any element in *S* as subsequence, when read as base *b* representation, which are > *b*, are composite).

("the set of the minimal elements of the base *b* representations of the prime numbers > *b* under the subsequence ordering" = *S* is proved if and only if all these three problems are proved, i.e. "the set of the minimal elements of the base *b* representations of the prime numbers > *b* under the subsequence ordering" = *S* is a theorem if and only if all these three "conjectures" are theorems)

e.g. proving that "the set of the minimal elements of the base 10 representations of the prime numbers > 10 under the subsequence ordering" = {11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 227, 251, 257, 277, 281, 349, 409, 449, 499, 521, 557, 577, 587, 727, 757, 787, 821, 827, 857, 877, 881, 887, 991, 2087, 2221, 5051, 5081, 5501, 5581, 5801, 5851, 6469, 6949, 8501, 9001, 9049, 9221, 9551, 9649, 9851, 9949, 20021, 20201, 50207, 60649, 80051, 666649, 946669, 5200007, 22000001, 60000049, 66000049, 66600049, 80555551, 555555555551, 5000000000000000000000000000027}, is equivalent to:

(since for base *b* = 10, all these three problems are proved, i.e. all they are theorems, thus, "the set of the minimal elements of the base 10 representations of the prime numbers > 10 under the subsequence ordering" = {11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 227, 251, 257, 277, 281, 349, 409, 449, 499, 521, 557, 577, 587, 727, 757, 787, 821, 827, 857, 877, 881, 887, 991, 2087, 2221, 5051, 5081, 5501, 5581, 5801, 5851, 6469, 6949, 8501, 9001, 9049, 9221, 9551, 9649, 9851, 9949, 20021, 20201, 50207, 60649, 80051, 666649, 946669, 5200007, 22000001, 60000049, 66000049, 66600049, 80555551, 555555555551, 5000000000000000000000000000027} is also proved, i.e. "the set of the minimal elements of the base 10 representations of the prime numbers > 10 under the subsequence ordering" = {11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 227, 251, 257, 277, 281, 349, 409, 449, 499, 521, 557, 577, 587, 727, 757, 787, 821, 827, 857, 877, 881, 887, 991, 2087, 2221, 5051, 5081, 5501, 5581, 5801, 5851, 6469, 6949, 8501, 9001, 9049, 9221, 9551, 9649, 9851, 9949, 20021, 20201, 50207, 60649, 80051, 666649, 946669, 5200007, 22000001, 60000049, 66000049, 66600049, 80555551, 555555555551, 5000000000000000000000000000027} is also a theorem)

Theorem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Theorem.html, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/): The set of the minimal elements of the base 10 representations of the prime numbers > 10 under the subsequence ordering is {11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 227, 251, 257, 277, 281, 349, 409, 449, 499, 521, 557, 577, 587, 727, 757, 787, 821, 827, 857, 877, 881, 887, 991, 2087, 2221, 5051, 5081, 5501, 5581, 5801, 5851, 6469, 6949, 8501, 9001, 9049, 9221, 9551, 9649, 9851, 9949, 20021, 20201, 50207, 60649, 80051, 666649, 946669, 5200007, 22000001, 60000049, 66000049, 66600049, 80555551, 555555555551, 5000000000000000000000000000027}

Proof (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Proof.html, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/): (this proof uses the notation in http://www.wiskundemeisjes.nl/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/minimal.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_12.pdf), i.e. "*X* ◁ *Y*" means "*X* is a subsequence of *Y*") (below, *𝜆* is the empty string (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_string)) (**bold** for minimal primes)

Assume *p* is a prime > 10, and the last digit of *p* must lie in {1,3,7,9}

Case 1: *p* ends with 1.

In this case we can write *p* = *x*1. If *x* contains 1, 3, 4, 6, or 7, then (respectively) **11** ◁ *p*, **31** ◁ *p*, **41** ◁ *p*, **61** ◁ *p*, or **71** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *x* are 0, 2, 5, 8, or 9.

Case 1.1: *p* begins with 2.

In this case we can write *p* = 2*y*1. If 5 ◁ *y*, then **251** ◁ *p*. If 8 ◁ *y*, then **281** ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *y*, then 29 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0 or 2.

If 22 ◁ *y*, then **2221** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* contains zero or one 2's.

If *y* contains no 2's, then *p* ∈ 2{0}1. But then, since the sum of the digits of *p* is 3, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime.

If *y* contains exactly one 2, then we can write *p* = 2*z*2*w*1, where *z*,*w* ∈ {0}. If 0 ◁ *z* and 0 ◁ *w*, then **20201** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume either *z* or *w* is empty.

If *z* is empty, then *p* ∈ 22{0}1, and the smallest prime *p* ∈ 22{0}1 is **22000001**.

If *w* is empty, then *p* ∈ 2{0}21, and the smallest prime *p* ∈ 2{0}21 is **20021**.

Case 1.2: *p* begins with 5.

In this case we can write *p* = 5*y*1. If 2 ◁ *y*, then **521** ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *y*, then 59 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0, 5, or 8.

If 05 ◁ *y*, then **5051** ◁ *p*. If 08 ◁ *y*, then **5081** ◁ *p*. If 50 ◁ *y*, then **5501** ◁ *p*. If 58 ◁ *y*, then **5581** ◁ *p*. If 80 ◁ *y*, then **5801** ◁ *p*. If 85 ◁ *y*, then **5851** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* ∈ {0} ∪ {5} ∪ {8}.

If *y* ∈ {0}, then *p* ∈ 5{0}1. But then, since the sum of the digits of *p* is 6, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime.

If *y* ∈ {5}, then *p* ∈ 5{5}1, and the smallest prime *p* ∈ 5{5}1 is **555555555551**.

If *y* ∈ {8}, since if 88 ◁ *y*, then 881 ◁ *p*, hence we may assume *y* ∈ {*𝜆*,8}, and thus *p* ∈ {51,581}, but 51 and 581 are both composite.

Case 1.3: *p* begins with 8.

In this case we can write p = 8*y*1. If 2 ◁ *y*, then **821** ◁ *p*. If 8 ◁ *y*, then **881** ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *y*, then 89 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0 or 5.

If 50 ◁ *y*, then **8501** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume y ∈ {0}{5}.

If 005 ◁ *y*, then **80051** ◁ p. Hence we may assume y ∈ {0} ∪ {5} ∪ 0{5}.

If y ∈ {0}, then *p* ∈ 8{0}1. But then, since the sum of the digits of *p* is 9, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime.

If y ∈ {5}, since if 55555555555 ◁ *y*, then 555555555551 ◁ *p*, hence we may assume *y* ∈ {*𝜆*, 5, 55, 555, 5555, 55555, 555555, 5555555, 55555555, 555555555, 5555555555}, and thus *p* ∈ {81, 851, 8551, 85551, 855551, 8555551, 85555551, 855555551, 8555555551, 85555555551, 855555555551}, but all of these numbers are composite.

If y ∈ 0{5}, since if 55555555555 ◁ *y*, then 555555555551 ◁ *p*, hence we may assume *y* ∈ {0, 05, 055, 0555, 05555, 055555, 0555555, 05555555, 055555555, 0555555555, 05555555555}, and thus *p* ∈ {801, 8051, 80551, 805551, 8055551, 80555551, 805555551, 8055555551, 80555555551, 805555555551, 8055555555551}, and of these numbers only 80555551 and 8055555551 are primes, but 80555551 ◁ 8055555551, thus only **80555551** is minimal prime.

Case 1.4: *p* begins with 9.

In this case we can write p = 9*y*1. If 9 ◁ *y*, then **991** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0, 2, 5, or 8.

If 00 ◁ *y*, then **9001** ◁ *p*. If 22 ◁ *y*, then **9221** ◁ *p*. If 55 ◁ *y*, then **9551** ◁ *p*. If 88 ◁ *y*, then 881 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* contains at most one 0, at most one 2, at most one 5, and at most one 8.

If *y* only contains at most one 0 and does not contain any of {2,5,8}, then *y* ∈ {*𝜆*,0}, and thus *p* ∈ {91,901}, but 91 and 901 are both composite. If *y* only contains at most one 0 and only one of {2,5,8}, then the sum of the digits of *p* is divisible by 3, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime. Hence we may assume *y* contains at least two of {2,5,8}.

If 25 ◁ *y*, then 251 ◁ *p*. If 28 ◁ *y*, then 281 ◁ *p*. If 52 ◁ *y*, then 521 ◁ *p*. If 82 ◁ *y*, then 821 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* contains no 2's (since if *y* contains 2, then *y* cannot contain either 5's or 8's, which is a contradiction).

If 85 ◁ *y*, then **9851** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* ∈ {58,580,508,058}, and thus *p* ∈ {9581,95801,95081,90581}, and of these numbers only 95801 is prime, but 95801 is not minimal prime since 5801 ◁ 95801.

Case 2: *p* ends with 3.

In this case we can write p = *x*3. If *x* contains 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, or 8, then (respectively) **13** ◁ *p*, **23** ◁ *p*, **43** ◁ *p*, **53** ◁ *p*, **73** ◁ *p*, or **83** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *x* are 0, 3, 6, or 9, and thus all digits of *p* are 0, 3, 6, or 9. But then, since the digits of *p* all have a common factor 3, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime.

Case 3: *p* ends with 7.

In this case we can write *p* = *x*7. If *x* contains 1, 3, 4, 6, or 9, then (respectively) **17** ◁ *p*, **37** ◁ *p*, **47** ◁ *p*, **67** ◁ *p*, or **97** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *x* are 0, 2, 5, 7, or 8.

Case 3.1: *p* begins with 2.

In this case we can write *p* = 2*y*7. If 2 ◁ *y*, then **227** ◁ *p*. If 5 ◁ *y*, then **257** ◁ *p*. If 7 ◁ *y*, then **277** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0 or 8.

If 08 ◁ *y*, then **2087** ◁ *p*. If 88 ◁ *y*, then 887 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* ∈ {0} ∪ 8{0}.

If *y* ∈ {0}, then *p* ∈ 2{0}7. But then, since the sum of the digits of *p* is 9, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime.

If y ∈ 8{0}, then *p* ∈ 28{0}7. But then *p* is divisible by 7, since for *n* ≥ 0 we have 7 × 40<sub>*n*</sub>1 = 280<sub>*n*</sub>7.

Case 3.2: *p* begins with 5.

In this case we can write *p* = 5*y*7. If 5 ◁ *y*, then **557** ◁ *p*. If 7 ◁ *y*, then **577** ◁ *p*. If 8 ◁ *y*, then **587** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0 or 2.

If 22 ◁ *y*, then 227 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* contains zero or one 2's.

If *y* contains no 2's, then *p* ∈ 5{0}7. But then, since the sum of the digits of *p* is 12, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime.

If *y* contains exactly one 2, then we can write *p* = 5*z*2*w*7, where *z*,*w* ∈ {0}. If 0 ◁ *z* and 0 ◁ *w*, then **50207** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume either *z* or *w* is empty.

If *z* is empty, then *p* ∈ 52{0}7, and the smallest prime *p* ∈ 52{0}7 is **5200007**.

If *w* is empty, then *p* ∈ 5{0}27, and the smallest prime *p* ∈ 5{0}27 is **5000000000000000000000000000027**.

Case 3.3: *p* begins with 7.

In this case we can write *p* = 7*y*7. If 2 ◁ *y*, then **727** ◁ *p*. If 5 ◁ *y*, then **757** ◁ *p*. If 8 ◁ *y*, then **787** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0 or 7, and thus all digits of *p* are 0 or 7. But then, since the digits of *p* all have a common factor 7, *p* is divisible by 7, so *p* cannot be prime.

Case 3.4: *p* begins with 8.

In this case we can write *p* = 8*y*7. If 2 ◁ *y*, then **827** ◁ *p*. If 5 ◁ *y*, then **857** ◁ *p*. If 7 ◁ *y*, then **877** ◁ *p*. If 8 ◁ *y*, then **887** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* ∈ {0}, and thus *p* ∈ 8{0}7. But then, since the sum of the digits of *p* is 15, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime.

Case 4: *p* ends with 9.

In this case we can write *p* = *x*9. If *x* contains 1, 2, 5, 7, or 8, then (respectively) **19** ◁ *p*, **29** ◁ *p*, **59** ◁ *p*, **79** ◁ *p*, or **89** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *x* are 0, 3, 4, 6, or 9.

If 44 ◁ *x*, then **449** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *x* contains zero or one 4's.

If x contains no 4's, then all digits of *x* are 0, 3, 6, or 9, and thus all digits of *p* are 0, 3, 6, or 9. But then, since the digits of *p* all have a common factor 3, *p* is divisible by 3, so *p* cannot be prime. Hence we may assume that *x* contains exactly one 4.

Case 4.1: *p* begins with 3.

In this case we can write *p* = 3*y*4*z*9, where all digits of *y*, *z* are 0, 3, 6, or 9. We must have **349** ◁ *p*.

Case 4.2: *p* begins with 4.

In this case we can write *p* = 4*y*9, where all digits of *y* are 0, 3, 6, or 9. If 0 ◁ *y*, then **409** ◁ *p*. If 3 ◁ *y*, then 43 ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *y*, then **499** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* ∈ {6}, and thus *p* ∈ 4{6}9. But then *p* is divisible by 7, since for *n* ≥ 0 we have 7 × 6<sub>*n*</sub>7 = 46<sub>*n*</sub>9.

Case 4.3: *p* begins with 6.

In this case we can write p = 6*y*4*z*9, where all digits of *y*, *z* are 0, 3, 6, or 9. If 0 ◁ *z*, then 409 ◁ *p*. If 3 ◁ *z*, then 43 ◁ *p*. If 6 ◁ *z*, then **6469** ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *z*, then 499 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *z* is empty.

If 3 ◁ *y*, then 349 ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *y*, then **6949** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume all digits of *y* are 0 or 6.

If 06 ◁ *y*, then **60649** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* ∈ {6}{0}.

If 666 ◁ *y*, then **666649** ◁ *p*. If 00000 ◁ *y*, then **60000049** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* ∈ {*𝜆*, 0, 00, 000, 0000, 6, 60, 600, 6000, 60000, 66, 660, 6600, 66000, 660000}, and thus *p* ∈ {649, 6049, 60049, 600049, 6000049, 6649, 66049, 660049, 6600049, 66000049, 66649, 666049, 6660049, 66600049, 666000049}, and of these numbers only **66000049** and **66600049** are primes.

Case 4.4: *p* begins with 9.

In this case we can write p = 9*y*4*z*9, where all digits of *y*, *z* are 0, 3, 6, or 9. If 0 ◁ *y*, then **9049** ◁ *p*. If 3 ◁ *y*, then 349 ◁ *p*. If 6 ◁ *y*, then **9649** ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *y*, then **9949** ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *y* is empty.

If 0 ◁ *z*, then 409 ◁ *p*. If 3 ◁ *z*, then 43 ◁ *p*. If 9 ◁ *z*, then 499 ◁ *p*. Hence we may assume *z* ∈ {6}, and thus *p* ∈ 94{6}9, and the smallest prime *p* ∈ 94{6}9 is 946669.

The reader may enjoy trying to write the proof for bases *b* = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, of course, the proof for base *b* = 2 is trivial, since all primes *p* > 2 must start and end with 1 in base 2, thus we must have 11 ◁ *p*, however, for some bases *b* like 24 (the currently largest "proven" base *b*, including the primality proving for the primes in the set), it is almost impossible to write the proof by hand, since base *b* = 24 has too many (3409) minimal primes to write the proof, thus the C++ program code (for computer to compute (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) the proof) is made.

Determining the set of the minimal elements of a arbitrary set of strings under the subsequence ordering is in general unsolvable, and can be difficult even when this set is relatively simple (such as the base *b* representations of the prime numbers > *b*), also, determining the set of the minimal elements of a arbitrary set of strings under the subsequence ordering may be an open problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_problem, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/OpenQuestion.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/UnsolvedProblems.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/open.htm, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/conjectures/) or NP-complete (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NP-CompleteProblem.html) or an undecidable problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Undecidable.html), or an example of Gödel's incompleteness theorems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoedelsFirstIncompletenessTheorem.html) (like the continuum hypothesis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ContinuumHypothesis.html) and the halting problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HaltingProblem.html)), or as hard as the unsolved problems in mathematics, such as the Riemann hypothesis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/RiemannHypothesis.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RiemannHypothesis.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/open.htm#rh) and the *abc* conjecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_conjecture, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/abcConjecture.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/open.htm#abc) and the Schinzel's hypothesis *H* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schinzel%27s_hypothesis_H, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SchinzelsHypothesis.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/open.htm#h), which are the three famous hard problems in number theory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Number_theory, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NumberTheory.html).

The following is a "semi-algorithm" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-algorithm) that is guaranteed to produce the minimal elements of a arbitrary set of strings under the subsequence ordering, but it is not so easy to implement:

1. *M* := *∅* 
2. while (*L* ≠ *∅*) do
3. choose *x*, a shortest string in *L*
4. *M* := *M* ∪ {*x*}
5. *L* := *L* − *sup*({*x*})

In practice, for arbitrary *L*, we cannot feasibly carry out step 5. Instead, we work with *L*', some regular overapproximation to *L*, until we can show *L*' = *∅* (which implies *L* = *∅*). In practice, *L*' is usually chosen to be a finite union of sets of the form *L*<sub>1</sub>{*L*<sub>2</sub>}*L*<sub>3</sub>, where each of *L*<sub>1</sub>, *L*<sub>2</sub>, *L*<sub>3</sub> is finite. In the case we consider in this project, we then have to determine whether such a family contains a prime > *b* or not.

To solve this problem (i.e. to compute (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) the set of the minimal elements of the base *b* representations of the prime numbers > *b* under the subsequence ordering), we need to determine whether a given family contains a prime. In practice, if family *x*{*Y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *Y* is a set of digits in base *b*) could not be ruled out as only containing composites and *Y* contains two or more digits, then a relatively small prime > *b* could always be found in this family. Intuitively, this is because there are a large number of small strings in such a family, and at least one is likely to be prime (e.g. there are 2<sup>*n*−2</sup> strings of length *n* in the family 1{3,7}9, and there are over a thousand strings of length 12 in the family 1{3,7}9, thus it is very impossible that these numbers are all composite). In the case *Y* contains only one digit, this family is of the form *x*{*y*}*z*, and there is only a single string of each length > (the length of *x* + the length of *z*), and it is not known if the following decision problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_problem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DecisionProblem.html) is recursively solvable:

Problem: Given strings *x*, *z* (may be empty), a digit *y*, and a base *b*, does there exist a prime number whose base-*b* expansion is of the form *xy*<sub>*n*</sub>*z* for some *n* ≥ 0? (If we say "yes", then we should find such a prime (the smallest such prime may be very large, e.g. > 10<sup>25000</sup>, and if so, then we should use primality testing programs such as *PFGW* or *LLR* to find it, and before using these programs, we should use sieving programs such as *srsieve* (or *sr*1/2/5*sieve*) to remove the numbers either having small prime factors or having algebraic factors) and prove its primality (and if we want to solve the problem in this article, we should check whether this prime is the smallest such prime or not, i.e. prove all smaller numbers of the form *xy*<sub>*n*</sub>*z* with *n* ≥ 0 are composite, usually by trial division or Fermat primality test), and if we say "no", then we should prove that such prime does not exist, may by covering congruence, algebraic factorization, or combine of them)

An algorithm to solve this problem, for example, would allow us to decide if there are any additional Fermat primes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_number, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/FermatNumber.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Fermat_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FermatNumber.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FermatPrime.html, http://www.prothsearch.com/fermat.html, http://www.fermatsearch.org/) (of the form 2<sup>2<sup>*n*</sup></sup>+1) other than the known ones (corresponding to *n* = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). To see this, take *b* = 2, *x* = 1, *y* = 0, and *z* = 0<sub>16</sub>1. Since if 2<sup>*n*</sup>+1 is prime then *n* must be a power of two (http://yves.gallot.pagesperso-orange.fr/primes/math.html), a prime of the form *xy*<sub>*n*</sub>*z* in base *b* must be a new Fermat prime. Besides, it would allow us to decide if there are infinitely many Mersenne primes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/MersenneNumber.html, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/Mersennes.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Mersenne_number, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Mersenne_prime, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MersenneNumber.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MersennePrime.html, https://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=4, https://www.mersenne.org/, https://www.mersenne.org/primes/, https://www.mersenne.ca/, https://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/) (of the form 2<sup>*p*</sup>−1 with prime *p*). To see this, take *b* = 2, *x* = *𝜆* (the empty string (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_string)), y = 1, and z = 1<sub>*n*+1</sub>, where *n* is the exponent of the Mersenne prime which we want to know whether it is the largest Mersenne prime or not. Since if 2<sup>*n*</sup>−1 is prime then *n* must be a prime (https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/Theorem2.html), a prime of the form *xy*<sub>*n*</sub>*z* in base *b* must be a new Mersenne prime. Also, it would allow us to decide whether 78557 is the smallest Sierpinski number (i.e. odd numbers *k* such that *k*×2<sup>*n*</sup>+1 is composite for all *n* ≥ 1) (http://www.prothsearch.com/sierp.html, http://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=1647, http://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=972, http://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=1750, http://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=5758, http://www.primegrid.com/stats_sob_llr.php, http://www.primegrid.com/stats_psp_llr.php, http://www.primegrid.com/stats_esp_llr.php, https://web.archive.org/web/20160405211049/http://www.seventeenorbust.com/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_number, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/SierpinskiNumber.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_problem, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Proth_2_Sierpinski, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SierpinskiNumberoftheSecondKind.html, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_or_Bust, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Seventeen_or_Bust, https://web.archive.org/web/20190929190947/https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/ColbertNumber.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ColbertNumber.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#sierpinski, http://www.bitman.name/math/article/204 (in Italian), https://oeis.org/A076336) and whether 509203 is the smallest Riesel number (i.e. odd numbers *k* such that *k*×2<sup>*n*</sup>−1 is composite for all *n* ≥ 1) (http://www.prothsearch.com/rieselprob.html, http://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=1731, http://www.primegrid.com/stats_trp_llr.php, https://web.archive.org/web/20061021153313/http://stats.rieselsieve.com//queue.php, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riesel_number, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/RieselNumber.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Riesel_problem, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Riesel_2_Riesel, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RieselNumber.html, http://www.bitman.name/math/article/203 (in Italian), https://oeis.org/A076337, https://oeis.org/A101036), etc.

**My conjecture: If family *xy*<sub>***n***</sub>*z* (with fixed strings *x*, *z* (may be empty), fixed digit *y*, and variable *n*) in base *b* (with fixed *b* ≥ 2) cannot be proven to only contain composites or only contain finitely many primes (by covering congruence, algebraic factorization, or combine of them), then family *xy*<sub>***n***</sub>*z* in base *b* contains infinitely many primes (this is equivalent to: If form (*a*×*b*<sup>***n***</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) (with fixed integers *a* ≥ 1, *b* ≥ 2, *c* ≠ 0 (with *gcd*(*a*,*c*) = 1 and *gcd*(*b*,*c*) = 1), and variable *n*) cannot be proven to only contain composites or only contain finitely many primes (by covering congruence, algebraic factorization, or combine of them), then form (*a*×*b*<sup>***n***</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) contains infinitely many primes)**

(this conjecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjecture, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/Conjecture.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Conjecture.html) is very important for the problem in this article, since if this conjecture is in fact false, then there will may be some unsolved families which in fact contain no primes, thus the problem in this article in corresponding bases *b* will may be unsolvable (at least in current technology, unless someone find a new theorem (i.e. other than covering congruence, algebraic factorization, or combine of them) to prove that some families contain no primes, but I do not think that this is possible), however, this conjecture is currently to far to prove, much far than the Bunyakovsky conjecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunyakovsky_conjecture, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BouniakowskyConjecture.html) and even the Schinzel's hypothesis *H* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schinzel%27s_hypothesis_H, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SchinzelsHypothesis.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/open.htm#h), besides, this conjecture is reasonable, since there is a heuristic argument (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_argument, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/Heuristic.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Heuristic.html, http://www.utm.edu/~caldwell/preprints/Heuristics.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_112.pdf)) that all families which cannot be ruled out as only containing composites or only containing finitely many primes (by covering congruence, algebraic factorization, or combine of them) contain infinitely many primes (references: https://primes.utm.edu/mersenne/heuristic.html, https://primes.utm.edu/notes/faq/NextMersenne.html, https://web.archive.org/web/20100628035147/http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/98/exp_primes, https://mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=564786&postcount=3, https://mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=461665&postcount=7), since by the prime number theorem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/PrimeNumberThm.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumberTheorem.html, https://primes.utm.edu/howmany.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#pnt, https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Charles_R_Greathouse_IV/Tables_of_special_primes) the chance (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Probability.html) that a random (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/RandomNumber.html) *n*-digit base *b* number is prime is approximately (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/AsymptoticallyEqual.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Asymptotic.html) 1/*n* (more accurately, the chance is approximately 1/(*n*×*ln*(*b*)), where *ln* is the natural logarithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/Log.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NaturalLogarithm.html), i.e. the logarithm with base *e* = 2.718281828459... (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/e.html)). If one conjectures the numbers *xy*<sub>*n*</sub>*z* behave similarly you would expect 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... = ∞ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HarmonicSeries.html) primes of the form *xy*<sub>*n*</sub>*z*)

(this conjecture is for exponential sequences (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExponentialGrowth.html) (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) (with fixed integers *a* ≥ 1, *b* ≥ 2, *c* ≠ 0, *gcd*(*a*, *c*) = 1, *gcd*(*b*, *c*) = 1, and variable *n*), there is also a similar conjecture for polynomial sequences (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Polynomial.html) *a*<sub>0</sub>+*a*<sub>1</sub>*x*+*a*<sub>2</sub>*x*<sup>2</sup>+*a*<sub>3</sub>*x*<sup>3</sup>+...+*a*<sub>*n*−1</sub>*x*<sup>*n*−1</sup>+*a*<sub>*n*</sub>*x*<sup>*n*</sup> (with fixed *n*, *a*<sub>0</sub>, *a*<sub>1</sub>, *a*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *a*<sub>*n*</sub> and variable *x*): the Bunyakovsky conjecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunyakovsky_conjecture, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BouniakowskyConjecture.html), the condition is similar to this conjecture (divisible by small primes and algebraic factorizations), the main difference is that polynomial sequence cannot have a covering congruence with > 1 primes, nor have a combine of covering congruence and algebraic factorization)

We call families of the form *x*{*y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *y* is a digit in base *b*) "linear" families. Our
algorithm then proceeds as follows:

1. *M* := {minimal primes in base *b* of length 2 or 3}, *L* := union of all *x*{*Y*}*z* such that *x* ≠ 0 and *gcd*(*z*, *b*) = 1 and *Y* is the set of digits *y* such that *xyz* has no subsequence in *M*
2. While *L* contains non-simple families: Explore each family of *L*, and update *L*. Examine each family of *L* by:
2.1. Let *w* be the shortest string in the family. If *w* has a subsequence in *M*, then remove the family from *L*. If *w* represents a prime, then add *w* to *M* and remove the family from *L*.
2.2. If possible, simplify the family.
2.3. Using the techniques below (covering congruence, algebraic factorization, or combine of them), check if the family can be proven to only contain composites, and if so then remove the family from *L*.
3. Update *L*, after each split examine the new families as in step 2.

The process of exploring/examining/splitting a family can be concisely expressed in a tree of decompositions.

Some *x*{*y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *y* is a digit in base *b*) families can be proven to contain no primes > *b*, by covering congruence

We can show that: For the case of covering congruence, the numbers in the family are not equal to any element in *S*, if *n* makes the numbers > *b*, thus these factorizations are nontrivial; for the case of algebraic factorization (if the numbers are factored as *F* × *G* / *d*), both *F* and *G* are > *d*, if *n* makes the numbers > *b*, thus these factorizations are nontrivial (the exceptions are the base 9 family {1} and the base 25 family {1} and the base 32 family {1}. For the base 9 family {1}, the algebraic form is (9<sup>*n*</sup>−1)/8 with *n* ≥ 2, and can be factored to (3<sup>*n*</sup>−1) × (3<sup>*n*</sup>+1) / 8, if *n* ≥ 3, then both 3<sup>*n*</sup>−1 and 3<sup>*n*</sup>+1 are > 8, thus these factorizations are nontrivial, it only remains to check the case *n* = 2, but the number with *n* = 2 is 10 = 2 × 5 is not prime; for the base 25 family {1}, the algebraic form is (25<sup>*n*</sup>−1)/24 with *n* ≥ 2, and can be factored to (5<sup>*n*</sup>−1) × (5<sup>*n*</sup>+1) / 24, if *n* ≥ 3, then both 5<sup>*n*</sup>−1 and 5<sup>*n*</sup>+1 are > 24, thus these factorizations are nontrivial, it only remains to check the case *n* = 2, but the number with *n* = 2 is 26 = 2 × 13 is not prime; for the base 32 family {1}, the algebraic form is (32<sup>*n*</sup>−1)/31 with *n* ≥ 2, and can be factored to (2<sup>*n*</sup>−1) × (16<sup>*n*</sup>+8<sup>*n*</sup>+4<sup>*n*</sup>+2<sup>*n*</sup>+1) / 31, if *n* ≥ 6, then both 2<sup>*n*</sup>−1 and 16<sup>*n*</sup>+8<sup>*n*</sup>+4<sup>*n*</sup>+2<sup>*n*</sup>+1 are > 31, thus these factorizations are nontrivial, it only remains to check the cases *n* = 2, 3, 4, 5, but the numbers with *n* = 2, 3, 4, 5 are 33 = 3 × 11, 1057 = 7 × 151, 33825 = 3 × 5<sup>2</sup> × 11 × 41, 1082401 = 601 × 1801 are not primes); for the case of combine of covering congruence and algebraic factorization (if the numbers are factored as *F* × *G* / *d*), the numbers in the family are not equal to any element in *S* and both *F* and *G* are > *d*, if *n* makes the numbers > *b*, thus these factorizations are nontrivial.

Some *x*{*y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *y* is a digit in base *b*) families could not be proven to contain no primes > *b* (by covering congruence, algebraic factorization, or combine of them) but no primes > *b* could be found in the family, even after searching through numbers with over 100000 digits. In such a case, the only way to proceed is to test the primality of larger and larger numbers of such form and hope a prime is eventually discovered.

This program uses the baby-step giant-step (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby-step_giant-step) algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Algorithm, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Algorithm.html) to find all primes *p* which divide *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c* where *p* and *n* lie in a specified range (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics), https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Interval.html), by using discrete logarithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiscreteLogarithm.html) to solve the equation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Equation.html) *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c* == 0 mod *p* (i.e. solve the equation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Equation.html) *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c* = 0 in the finite field (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FiniteField.html) *Z*<sub>*p*</sub>) (also, this program was updated so that it also removes the *n* such that *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c* has algebraic factors (e.g. difference-of-two-squares factorization (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_two_squares) and sum/difference-of-two-*n*th-powers factorization with odd *n* > 1 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_number, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BinomialNumber.html) and Aurifeuillean factorization (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurifeuillean_factorization, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Aurifeuillian_factor, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/AurifeuilleanFactorization.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/numbers.htm#aurifeuille, http://pagesperso-orange.fr/colin.barker/lpa/cycl_fac.htm, http://list.seqfan.eu/oldermail/seqfan/2017-March/017363.html, http://myfactorcollection.mooo.com:8090/source/cyclo.cpp, http://myfactorcollection.mooo.com:8090/LCD_2_199, http://myfactorcollection.mooo.com:8090/LCD_2_998, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/repunit/repunitnote.htm#aurifeuillean, https://www.unshlump.com/hcn/aurif.html) of *x*<sup>4</sup>+4×*y*<sup>4</sup> or *x*<sup>6</sup>+27×*y*<sup>6</sup>), see https://mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=452132&postcount=66 and https://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=21916 and https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/blob/main/srsieve_1.1.4/algebraic.c (note: for the sequence (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1), the case of "Mersenne number" in https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/blob/main/srsieve_1.1.4/algebraic.c is the case which *a* is rational power of *b*, *c* = −1 and the case which *a* is rational power of *b*, *c* = 1, *gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) ≥ 3, and the case of "GFN" in https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/blob/main/srsieve_1.1.4/algebraic.c is the case which *a* is rational power of *b*, *c* = 1, *gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) is either 1 or 2)). Since this program cannot handle the general case (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) when *gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) > 1 we only used it to sieve the sequence *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c* for primes *p* not dividing *gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1), and initialized the list of candidates to not include *n* for which there is some prime *p* dividing *gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) for which *p* dividing (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1). The program had to be modified slightly to remove a check which would prevent it from running in the case when *a*, *b*, and *c* were all odd (since then 2 divides *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*, but 2 may not divide (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1)) (see https://github.com/curtisbright/mepn-data/commit/1b55b353f46c707bbe52897573914128b3303960).

Once the numbers with small divisors had been removed, it remained to test the remaining numbers using a probable primality test. For this we used the software *LLR* by Jean Penné (http://jpenne.free.fr/index2.html, https://primes.utm.edu/bios/page.php?id=431, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/LLR, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/tree/main/llr403win64, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/tree/main/llr403linux64) or *PFGW* (https://sourceforge.net/projects/openpfgw/, https://primes.utm.edu/bios/page.php?id=175, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/PFGW, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/tree/main/pfgw_win_4.0.3). Although undocumented, it is possible to run these two programs on numbers of the form (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*d* when *d* > 1 (however, of course, the numbers (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*d* with |*c*| ≠ 1 and/or *d* <> 1 and/or *a* > *b*<sup>*n*</sup> can only be PRP (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_prime, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/PRP.html, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Probable_prime, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ProbablePrime.html, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/records.htm#probableprimenumbers, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/repunit/prpfactors.htm, http://factordb.com/listtype.php?t=1) tested; the numbers *a*×2<sup>*n*</sup>±1 (with *a* < 2<sup>*n*</sup>) are the fastest to test, *a*×2<sup>*n*</sup>+1 numbers are tested using the Proth algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proth%27s_theorem, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Proth%27s_theorem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ProthsTheorem.html, http://www.numericana.com/answer/primes.htm#proth), *a*×2<sup>*n*</sup>−1 numbers are tested using the Lucas-Lehmer-Riesel algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas%E2%80%93Lehmer%E2%80%93Riesel_test); the numbers *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>±1 (with *b* > 2, *a* < *b*<sup>*n*</sup>) can also be definitely prime (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provable_prime, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/records.htm#primenumbers, http://factordb.com/listtype.php?t=4) tested, *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+1 numbers are tested using the *N*−1 Pocklington algorithm (https://primes.utm.edu/prove/prove3_1.html, http://bln.curtisbright.com/2013/10/09/the-n-1-and-n1-primality-tests/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocklington_primality_test, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Pocklington%27s_theorem, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PocklingtonsTheorem.html, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/pock/, http://factordb.com/nmoverview.php?method=1), *a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1 numbers are tested using the *N*+1 Morrison algorithm (https://primes.utm.edu/prove/prove3_2.html, http://bln.curtisbright.com/2013/10/09/the-n-1-and-n1-primality-tests/, http://factordb.com/nmoverview.php?method=2)), so this program required no modifications. A script was also written which allowed one to run srsieve while *LLR* or *PFGW* was testing the remaining candidates, so that when a divisor was found by srsieve on a number which had not yet been tested by *LLR* or *PFGW* it would be removed from the list of candidates.

For the primes < 10<sup>25000</sup> for the solved or near-solved bases (bases *b* with ≤ 6 unsolved families, i.e. bases *b* = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 36), we employed *PRIMO* by Marcel Martin (http://www.ellipsa.eu/public/primo/primo.html, http://www.rieselprime.de/dl/Primo309.zip, https://primes.utm.edu/bios/page.php?id=46, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Primo, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/tree/main/primo-433-lx64, https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/prime-programs-cached-copy/tree/main/Primo309), an elliptic curve primality proving (https://primes.utm.edu/prove/prove4_2.html, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_primality, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/ECPP.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EllipticCurvePrimalityProving.html, https://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=27) implementation, to compute primality certificates (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_certificate, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/Certificate.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimalityCertificate.html, http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Francois.Morain/Primes/myprimes.html, https://stdkmd.net/nrr/cert/, http://factordb.com/certoverview.php) for the candidates for minimal prime base *b* which are > 10<sup>299</sup> and neither *N*−1 nor *N*+1 can be ≥ 1/3 factored (need *CHG* proof if either *N*−1 or *N*+1 (or both) can be ≥ 1/4 factored but neither can be ≥ 1/3 factored, but *factordb* (http://factordb.com/, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Factoring_Database) lacks the ability to verify *CHG* proofs, see https://mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=608362&postcount=165).

Some of the left families may cover another left family, e.g. the base 19 left family 5{H}5 covers another base 19 left family 5{H}05, and if the smallest prime in family 5{H}5 in base 19 has length *n*, and the family 5{H}05 in base 19 has no prime with length ≤ *n*, then family 5{H}05 in base 19 can be removed from the unsolved families for base 19, however, if the smallest prime in family 5{H}5 in base 19 has length *n*, but the family 5{H}05 in base 19 is not tested to length *n* or more, then family 5{H}05 in base 19 should not be removed from the unsolved families for base 19, since a number in family 5{H}05 covers the prime in family 5{H}5 with length *n* if and only if the length of this number is ≥ *n*+1; besides, the base 19 left family FH0{H} covers another base 19 left family FHHH0{H}, and if the smallest prime in family FH0{H} in base 19 has length *n*, and the family FHHH0{H} in base 19 has no prime with length ≤ *n*+1, then family FHHH0{H} in base 19 can be removed from the unsolved families for base 19, however, if the smallest prime in family FH0{H} in base 19 has length *n*, but the family FHHH0{H} in base 19 is not tested to length *n*+1 or more, then family FHHH0{H} in base 19 should not be removed from the unsolved families for base 19, since a number in family FHHH0{H} covers the prime in family FH0{H} with length *n* if and only if the length of this number is ≥ *n*+2; besides, the base 21 left family {9}D covers another base 21 left family F{9}D, and if the smallest prime in family {9}D in base 21 has length *n*, and the family F{9}D in base 21 has no prime with length ≤ *n*, then family F{9}D in base 21 can be removed from the unsolved families for base 21, however, if the smallest prime in family {9}D in base 21 has length *n*, but the family F{9}D in base 21 is not tested to length *n* or more, then family F{9}D in base 21 should not be removed from the unsolved families for base 21, since a number in family F{9}D covers the prime in family {9}D with length *n* if and only if the length of this number is ≥ *n*+1 (if a family has no primes, then we say "the smallest prime in this family has length ∞ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/Infinite.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Infinity.html) (instead of 0 or −1)", see http://gladhoboexpress.blogspot.com/2019/05/prime-sandwiches-made-with-one-derbread.html and http://chesswanks.com/seq/a306861.txt (for the *OEIS* sequence https://oeis.org/A306861) and http://chesswanks.com/seq/a269254.txt (for the *OEIS* sequence https://oeis.org/A269254) (since this is more convenient, e.g. the *n* of the smallest prime in the base 13 family A3<sub>*n*</sub>A, this family has been searched to *n* = 358000 with no prime or probable prime found, we can use ">358000" for the *n* of the smallest prime in the base 13 family A3<sub>*n*</sub>A (while for the *n* of the smallest prime in the base 13 family 95<sub>*n*</sub>, it is 197420), ">358000" includes infinity (since infinity is > 358000) but does not includes 0 or −1, it is still possible that there is no prime in the base 13 family A3<sub>*n*</sub>A, although by the heuristic argument (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_argument, https://primes.utm.edu/glossary/xpage/Heuristic.html, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Heuristic.html, http://www.utm.edu/~caldwell/preprints/Heuristics.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_112.pdf)) above, this is very impossible, also "the smallest *n* ≥ 1 such that (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) is prime" should be the infimum (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infimum, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Infimum.html) of the set *S* of the numbers *n* ≥ 1 such that (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) is prime, and if there is no *n* ≥ 1 such that (*a*×*b*<sup>*n*</sup>+*c*)/*gcd*(*a*+*c*,*b*−1) is prime, then this set *S* is the empty set (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EmptySet.html), and by the definition of "inf", the infimum of the empty set is ∞), ∞ is > any finite number, e.g. "the smallest *n* ≥ 1 such that *k*×2<sup>*n*</sup>+1 is prime" is ∞ for *k* = 78557, 157114, 271129, 271577, 314228, 322523, 327739, 482719, ..., while it is 31172165 for *k* = 10223 and 13018586 for *k* = 19249, another example is "the smallest *n* such that (*b*<sup>*n*</sup>−1)/(*b*−1) is prime" is ∞ for *b* = 9, 25, 32, 49, 64, 81, 121, 125, 144, 169, 216, 225, 243, 289, 324, 343, 361, 441, 484, 529, 625, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961, 1000, ..., while it is 62903 for *b* = 691 and 41189 for *b* = 693).

There are also unproven probable primes (however, in this project our results assume that they are in fact primes, since they are > 10<sup>25000</sup> and the probability that they are in fact composite is < 10<sup>−2000</sup>, see https://primes.utm.edu/notes/prp_prob.html and https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1989-53-188/S0025-5718-1989-0982368-4/S0025-5718-1989-0982368-4.pdf (cached copy at https://github.com/xayahrainie4793/pdf-files-cached-copy/blob/main/pdf_22.pdf)), the unproven probable primes for bases *b* = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 36 (the solved or near-solved bases, i.e. the bases *b* with ≤ 6 unsolved families) are (together with the factorization of the numbers in their corresponding families): (you can click the "show" in the *factordb* page to see these unproven probable primes written in base 10 and base *b* as well as the length of these unproven probable primes in base 10 and base *b* (for base *b*, change the "10" in "Digits (Base 10)" box to "*b*", support bases 2 ≤ *b* ≤ 36), also you can click the "*N*−1" or the "*N*+1" (open the "Primality proving" box) to see the factorization of *N*−1 and *N*+1)

(for the factorization of the numbers in these families, the special number field sieve (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_number_field_sieve, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/Special_number_field_sieve, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NumberFieldSieve.html) or the general number field sieve (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve, https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/General_number_field_sieve, https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NumberFieldSieve.html) may be used, they have *SNFS* polynomials (https://www.rieselprime.de/ziki/SNFS_polynomial_selection), just like factorization of the numbers in https://stdkmd.net/nrr/aaaab.htm and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/abbbb.htm and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/aaaba.htm and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/abaaa.htm and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/abbba.htm and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/abbbc.htm and http://mklasson.com/factors/index.php and https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rpropper/math/factors/3n-2.txt, see https://stdkmd.net/nrr/records.htm and https://stdkmd.net/nrr/wanted.htm)

For the files in this page:

* File "kernel *b*": Data for all known minimal primes in base *b*, expressed as base *b* strings
* File "left *b*": *x*{*y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *y* is a digit in base *b*) families in base *b* such that we were unable to determine if they contain a prime > *b* or not (i.e. *x*{*y*}*z* (where *x* and *z* are strings (may be empty) of digits in base *b*, *y* is a digit in base *b*) families in base *b* such that no prime member > *b* could be found, nor could the family be ruled out as only containing composites (only count the numbers > *b*)), these families are sorted by "the length *n* number in these families, from the smallest number to the largest number, this *n* is large enough such that *n* replaced to any larger number does not affect the sorting" (e.g. for base 17, we sort with B{0}B3 -> B{0}DB -> {B}2BE -> {B}2E -> {B}E9 -> {B}EE, since in this case 7 digits is enough, B0000B3 < B0000DB < BBBB2BE < BBBBB2E < BBBBBE9 < BBBBBEE, if the 7 replaced to any larger number, this result of the sorting will not change)
